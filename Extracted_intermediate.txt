223. Carl Hamppe – Wilhelm Steinitz, Vienna 1859
21...¥xd4†! 22.¢h1 22.cxd4 £xh2 mate ; Or 22.¦f2 £xh2†–+ when the crucial h2-pawn can 
be taken as both white pieces are pinned. 22...¦xg3–+  Black won a piece and soon the game.


224. Wilhelm Steinitz – Strauss, Vienna 1860
23.¦xe6†! ¢xe6 23...fxe6 24.¥h6†+–  wins the queen. 24.£e4†  ¢d7 White’s position is 
winning and you don’t have to see any further. Steinitz played: 25.£xb7† ¢e6 26.¦e1† ¢f5 
27.£xf7† 27.£e4 mate! 27...¢g4 28.£f3† ¢h4 29.£h3 mate


225. Wilhelm Steinitz – Adolf Anderssen, London 1862
33...e3! Black had a dominant position and an extra pawn, so he could win slowly in many ways, 
but this is the quickest winner. 34.f3 Or 34.fxe3 ¦g6 quickly forces mate. 34...¦g6  It’s still 
a forced mate. 35.g4 fxg4 36.f4 ¥d5 37.¤d4 ¦a6 Pretty, but an even faster mate was possible 
with the prosaic 37...¦g2†. 38.¦xa6 ¦b1† 0–1 White resigned, rather than allow a mate such 
as: 39.¢h2 ¦h1† 40.¢g3 ¦g1† 41.¢h2 ¦g2† 42.¢h1 ¦g3† 43.¢h2 ¦h3† 44.¢g1 ¦h1 mate


226. Henry Bird – Wilhelm Steinitz, London (6) 1866
13...¦de8†! 13...¦he8†! comes to the same thing. 14.¥xe8 ¦xe8† 15.¢f2 £e3† Or 15...¥c5† 
16.¢g3 £h6! with a winning attack against the stranded king on g3. 16.¢f1 ¥xf3 17.gxf3 
 
¥c5!  0–1 The only move, with forced mate in two moves.


227. Wilhelm Steinitz – Henry Bird, London (9) 1866
9.h3! £xg2 9...£h5 10.g4+–  also traps the queen. 10.¦h2+–  Bird resigned after: 10...£xh2 
11.¤xh2 ¤xd4 12.¥b5†! 1–0


228. Wilhelm Steinitz – Hieronim Czarnowski, Paris 1867
21.¤c6†! £xc6 21...¥xc6 22.¥xc5†  ¢e8 23.¥xc6† £xc6 24.£xd8 mate. 22.¥xc6 ¥xe3 
22...¦xd2 23.¥xc5†+–  comes with check and wins a rook. 23.£b4† 1–0 Other moves were 
also winning.


229. Wilhelm Steinitz – Szymon Winawer, Paris 1867
White has a winning position, but can push his advantage with 17.£xg6!+– since Black cannot 
take back due to: 17...fxg6 18.f7† ¢d8 19.f8=£† ¦xf8 20.¦xf8 mate 


230. Wilhelm Steinitz – Emile D’Andre, Paris 1867
27.d6! White wins a piece after: 27...¥xd6 28.¥e6+– 


231. Wilhelm Steinitz – Walsh, London (simul) 1870
14.¤e6†! The knight cannot be taken due to the discovered attack. 14...¢e8 14...fxe6 
 
15.¥a5†+–  and 14...dxe6 15.¥a5†  wins the queen and the game. 15.¤bc7 mate 


232. Wilhelm Steinitz – Henry Bird, London 1870
White is a pawn down, so has to create something. 19.¤ge6! fxe6 It would have been better for 
Black to give up the exchange on f8 with 19...g6². With a pawn and opposite-coloured bishops 
for the exchange, Black has some compensation. Note that the bishop on b5 is essential after 
19...g5 20.¤xf8 gxf4 21.¤d7!.  Now, 21...¥d8 22.e5! is the only winning move, but that’s not 
necessary to see before sacrificing the knight. The point is 22...a6 23.exd6† ¢xd6 24.¤e5!+– 
threatening a fork on f7. 20.¤g6† ¢f7 The knight would not escape from h8 after 20...¢f6, 
but White has 21.¤xf8+– . 21.¤xh8† ¢f6 The knight looks trapped, but it has two ways 
to escape. 22.f4 22.¦e3 is also good: 22...g5 23.¦f3† ¢g7 24.¦xf8 ¢xf8 25.dxe6± with a safe 
square on f7. 22...¤e7 23.e5†!+–  ¢f5 24.¥d3†! 1–0 Not only can the white knight escape, 
the black king is mated!


233. Walter Grimshaw – Wilhelm Steinitz, Vienna 1872
14.¤c7†! ¢f8 14...¢e7 15.£d6 mate  15.£d6†! Forcing Black to set up a bank-rank mate. 
15...¤ge7 16.£d8†! Not 16.¤xa8? £a1† with some compensation for the exchange. 16...¤xd8 
17.¦xd8 mate 


234. C.E.A. Dupre – Wilhelm Steinitz, The Hague 1873
28.¤d6! c5 28...¦xd6 29.£e8  mate is easy, but 28...£xb2  is tricky. White’s best is to defend 
against the back-rank mate and take on d4 with the rook on the next move. Instead 29.£xd4?! 
£xd4 30.¦xd4 is probably winning, but not easily. 29.¦xd4!  1–0 The check on e6 is decisive. 


235. Wilhelm Steinitz – Jean Dufresne, Liverpool 1874
If only Black had time for 24...b6 and 25...¢b7 – it’s not going to happen. 24.d5†! ¢b6 
24...£xd5 25.¥e4  wins the queen and 24...¢xd5 is not a nice move to play. There are many 
ways to stop the king from returning to “safety”, and the fastest is 25.£h1† ¢c5 26.¥e3† ¥d4 
27.¥xd4 mate. 24...¢d7 is not the direction the king wants to go. However, Black threatens 
to shut out White’s rook with 25...¥e5. Best is 25.¦e6!+– when White continues with 26.f6 or 
26.¥b5†. 25.¥e3† 25.¦e4 also wins. Black’s king can’t go to c7 after 25...c5 26.¥d8†+–. 25...c5 
26.£d8†! The only winning move. 26...£c7 27.£xg8+–  And White won. 27.¥g5 or 27.£e8 
should also win.


236. Wilhelm Steinitz – Dion Martinez, Philadelphia (1) 1882
10...¤xd4!³ White loses the queen no matter which way he recaptures. 11.¥xf4 Steinitz played 
the unchallenging 11.c3. Also no help is 11.£xd4 ¥c5–+  or 11.¤xd4 £xd1–+ . 11...gxf4 
11...¤xf3?! 12.£d5!³ creates a pin along the fifth rank and wins back the piece. 12.¤xd4 Black 
did not win any material (he was a pawn up in the diagram), but destroying White’s centre is 
an achievement. 12...£h4† 12...£xd1 13.¦xd1³ is also good. However, due to White’s exposed 
king and undeveloped rook on h1, it’s more logical to keep on the queens. 13.¢g1 ¥c5³ Black 
continues with ...¤e7 or ...¤f6 and ...0–0.


237. Wilhelm Steinitz – Joseph Blackburne, Vienna 1882
23.¥xh6!+– White wins a pawn, since 23...gxh6? 24.¤f6† ¢h8 25.¤xe8  picks up the rook.


238. Joseph Blackburne – Wilhelm Steinitz, Vienna 1882
24.¦d7! Setting up a discovered attack. 24...£xd7 25.¤h6† gxh6 26.£xd7  Black resigned 
a move later.


239. Wilhelm Steinitz – Samuel Rosenthal, London 1883
33...¦g6†! 34.¥g3 ¦xg3†! 35.hxg3 f2†! 36.¢xf2 36.£xf2 £h1 mate  36...£g2† 37.¢e3 
£f3 mate 


240. Josef Noa – Wilhelm Steinitz, London 1883
12...d5!–+  Opening up for a pin on b4, winning a pawn to start with. 12...bxc4?! 13.¥xc4 
 
(or 13.¥a4) 13...d5 14.¥b5!² is not the way to exploit the exposed queen.


241. G.H. Thornton – Wilhelm Steinitz, New York 1884
25.¦xf7! White undermines the defence of the rook on e6 while simultaneously defending e1, and 
doesn’t have to worry unduly about the check on f1. 25...¦xf7 26.£xe6  26.¦d8†± is about as 
strong. 26...¦f1† 27.¥e1 £b6 28.£xb6?!± On account of Black’s open king, White should have 
kept the queens on the board with: 28.£e2+– 28...axb6 29.¢d2 ¢g8 30.¦d8† ¥f8 31.¦d7?! 
Better is 31.¥g3 with a winning position. 31...¥d6 32.¢e2? ¦g1 33.¢f2 ¦h1 34.¢e2 ¦g1 ½–½


242. Johannes Zukertort – Wilhelm Steinitz, USA (9) 1886
37...¦c8! 37...¥xg2? 38.¢xg2 ¦xd1 39.¦xd1 £g4† 40.£g3 £xd1 and Black is better, but not 
winning. However, White should not win back the pawn with 41.¦xh6†? ¢xh6 42.£h4† £h5 
43.£xd8 since the outside pawn majority decides after 43...£g5† 44.£xg5† ¢xg5. 38.¦xe4 
38.£xc8 £xd2  and the knight will fall, with mate following shortly. 38...£xe4  0–1 Black 
will win even more material, so White resigned. 38...fxe4? 39.£xc8 £xd2 40.£f5† is a perpetual.


243. Isidor Gunsberg – Wilhelm Steinitz, New York (12) 1891
23.¦xd7†! Black actually has no defence even after 23.¦d2+– followed by 24.¦ad1. 23...¢xd7 
24.¦d1† ¤d4 25.cxd4!+–  There follows one or two lethal discovered checks. But not 
25.¤xd4†? ¢e7 with an unclear position.


244. Wilhelm Steinitz – Armand Blackmar, Skaneateles (blindfold simul) 1891
8.¤xe5! 8.¥xc6?! £xc6 9.¤xe5 ¥xd1 10.¤xc6 ¥xc2= 8...¥xd1 9.¤xd7 ¢xd7 Black has no 
time for 9...¥xc2 since the bishop on c5 is en prise: 10.¤xc5+–  10.¢xd1± White is a pawn up.


245. Wilhelm Steinitz – Mikhail Chigorin, Havana (4) 1892
23.¦xd4!  Steinitz keeps the dark-squared bishop, and can always attack on the dark squares 
with ¥xe6 and a few heavy pieces on the h-file. The position is winning, and the end came quickly 
in the game. Instead 23.¥xd4†? ¤xd4 24.¦xd4 is about even. 23...¤xd4 24.¦xh7† Forcing 
mate, but not obligatory to see since the alternative is easy enough: 24.¥xd4† ¦f6 and White 
is winning if the queen hurries towards h6 with a threat along the way. There are three ways: 
a) 25.£b5 ¦ef8 26.£g5+–, b) 25.£d3 and c) 25.£d1. 24...¢xh7 25.£h1† ¢g7 26.¥h6† 
Or 26.£h6† ¢f6 27.£h4† ¢g7 28.¥h6† ¢h8 29.¥xf8 mate, or 29.¥g5† ¢g7 30.£h6 mate. 
26...¢f6 27.£h4† ¢e5 28.£xd4† Or 28.£g3† ¢e4 29.£e3† ¢f5 30.£f4 mate. When the 
queen took on d4, Chigorin resigned instead of allowing 28...¢f5 29.g4 mate or 29.£f4 mate.


246. City of Liverpool – Wilhelm Steinitz, corr. 1893
20...¦xd5! 20...¤d4?! 21.¥e7! is a nice resource, with the point that White can take back 
twice on e7 with check – thus not giving Black time to capture on h5. Black has to play: 
 
21...hxg6 22.fxg6 £xe7! (not 22...¥xg6?! 23.£xg6 ¦xe7 24.¤xf6†+– or 22...¦xe7?! 23.£h7† 
¢f8 24.¤xf6+–) 23.¤xe7† ¦xe7 Black is not losing, but probably worse and certainly not 
winning as in the game. 21.exd5 ¤d4 22.¤e7† There is no defence against 22...¤xf5 23.¦xf5 
hxg6  winning material. 22...£xe7  It’s over, which White soon accepted.


247. Carl Walbrodt – Wilhelm Steinitz, Hastings 1895
29...¤xf2! 30.¤xf2 £e1† Black has a mating attack. 31.¢h2 31.£f1 ¥xf2†–+ wins the queen 
and mates. 31...¥xf2  32.h4 h5 0–1 Not the only way to mate, but the quickest. 


248. Emanuel Schiffers – Wilhelm Steinitz, Hastings 1895
19...¥xg3! 20.fxg3 ¦xf1† Including 20...£e3† ruins nothing. 21.£xf1 The point of the sacrifice 
is: 21.¢xf1 ¥xg4 22.£xg4 £xc1†–+  21...¥xg4 22.£f4! £xf4 23.gxf4³ Black is a pawn up, 
but the opposite-coloured bishops give White fair hopes of making a draw; Schiffers did not 
manage though.


249. Dawid Janowski – Wilhelm Steinitz, Hastings 1895
17.¦xe6! £xb5 17...£xe6 18.¤c7†+–  forks king and queen. 18.¥h6 18.¥d2 and 18.¥f4 
are also winning. Black can’t move the king without giving up the pawn on f7, and 19.¦ae1 not 
only threatens the bishop on e7, but also the pawn on f6. 18...¢d8 19.£xf7 ¦e8 20.¦ae1 £d7 
21.¥g7 Black resigned three moves later.


250. Wilhelm Steinitz – Emanuel Schiffers, Rostov on Don (2) 1896
13.¥xh6!+– Schiffers now accepted that he had lost a pawn. 13...gxh6 The game went 13...£d7+– 
and White won after 41 moves. 14.¦xe6! The point of the sacrifice. 14...fxe6 15.£g6† ¢h8 
16.£xh6† ¢g8 White can choose between picking up the knight on d5 with 17.£xe6†  or 
being more brilliant by continuing the attack with: 17.£g6† ¢h8 18.¤g5 (or 18.£h5† ¢g8 
19.£g4† ¢h8 20.¤g5+–) 18...£e7 19.£h5† ¢g8 20.¤xe6 There are also other ways to win.


251. Bobrov – Wilhelm Steinitz, Moscow (simul) 1896
25.£d8† ¥f8 26.¦h8†! ¢xh8 27.£xf8† ¢h7 28.£xf7† ¢h8 29.¥xg6+–  1–0 Black can 
only avoid the mate by giving up his queen. 29.£xg6+– also forces Black to give up the queen, 
but worse is 29.£f6†?! ¢g8 30.£xg6† when White captures the pawn with check, but Black can 
fight on after 30...¢f8+–.


252. Emanuel Lasker – Wilhelm Steinitz, Moscow (2) 1896
35.¤ec5†! 35.¤bc5† is the same and 35.¤xd6 also wins, but only if White finds: 35...¢xd6 
36.¥f4† ¢d5 (36...¢d7 37.¤c5† ¢e8 38.¥d6!+–) 37.¦e5† ¢c4 38.¤c5! White threatens mate-
in-three with 39.¦c1† and the try 38...b4 39.b3†! ¢b5 40.¦xe7! ¥xe7 41.¦xe7! is hopeless (full 
points if you saw this far). White wins back the exchange after 41...¦b6 42.¥c7. White also has a 
winning position after 35.¥f4 ¤f5 36.¤bc5† ¢c7 37.¤a6†. 35...dxc5 36.¤xc5† ¢d6 37.¥f4†  
 
37.¥xe7† is also winning and good enough for full points. The text move forces mate in five 
moves: 37...¢d5 38.¦e5† ¢c4 39.¦c1† ¢xd4 40.¤b3† ¢d3 41.¦c3 mate Or 41.¦e3 mate.


253. Wilhelm Steinitz – Emanuel Lasker, Moscow (17) 1897
35...¥xg2! 36.¢xg2 £c6†–+  A double threat, winning back the piece and also another 
one. 36...£b7†? 37.¢h2 £xb4² only wins one piece. In the game, Steinitz tried to play on an 
exchange down with 37.¦e4 ¦xe4 38.¦xe4 £xe4† 39.¢g1, but in vain (0–1, 59 moves).


254. Wilhelm Steinitz – Joseph Blackburne, Vienna 1898
35.¥xc6! There is a looming check on e6. 35...f4 36.¦xf4! ¦xg3† 37.¢f2 Or 37.¢f1+–, but 
not 37.¢h2? ¦3g4³ and Black wins the bishop thanks to the mate on h4 if the rook protects 
the bishop. 37...¦h3 There is no perpetual or anything else compensating for the pawns after: 
37...¢xc6 38.¦e6† ¢c5 39.¦xh6  ¦g2† 40.¢e3+– 38.¥d5+– With a lot of luck, Blackburne 
held half a point in a long endgame (½–½, 93 moves).


255. Harry Pillsbury – Wilhelm Steinitz, Vienna 1898
25.¤f6! gxf6 26.£h4† Or 26.¥xf6† first. 26...¢g8 27.¥xf6+–  The double threat against h8 
and d8 wins material.


256. Rudolf Loman – Emanuel Lasker, Amsterdam 1889
13.¤xe5! Loman played 13.¥xf7†?! ¢xf7 14.¤xg5†? (14.¤xe5† dxe5 15.£xg4³), but he must 
have overlooked 14...£xg5! 15.¥xg5 ¥xd1–+ with a fork on f3 (0–1, 22 moves). 13...¥xd1 
13...dxe5 14.£xg4+–  doesn’t help. Instead, Black’s best try is 13...¤xb3 14.£xg4  ¤xc1 
(14...¤xa1 15.¥xg5! £c8 16.£f4 [or 16.£g3] 16...dxe5 17.£xe5† £e6 18.£xh8 with an almost 
winning advantage for White) White has a great initiative after 15.¤xf7± or he can win material 
with 15.¤f3±. 14.¥xf7† ¢e7 15.¤d5 mate  Or 15.¥xg5 mate.


257. Emanuel Lasker – Theodor von Scheve, Berlin 1890
25.¦xd3! £xd3 25...¦xd3 26.£xa8†+–  26.¦e8†! 1–0 Black resigned due to: 26...¦xe8 
27.£xd3+– 


258. Emanuel Lasker – Gustavus Reichhelm, Philadelphia (simul) 1892
34.¤xe6! ¥e8 34...£xe6 35.¦g6+–  35.¦g6! The only move. 35...£xg6 35...¥xg6 36.£xh6† 
¢g8 37.¤xf8! £xf8 38.£xg6†+–  36.£xg6 ¥xg6 37.¤xf8±  White is a pawn up and Black’s 
bishop is a horrible piece, but it is not clear there is a way to force a win, although putting the 
king on h4 and then pushing the d-pawn seems very promising (1–0, 50 moves).


259. Emanuel Lasker – Franklin Elson, Wakefield (simul) 1892
16.¥xg6!+– hxg6 After 16...£f8 17.¥xh7†+– Black later turned the game around 
 
(0–1, 62 moves) but that had more to do with the nature of a simul than his actual chances in this 
position. 17.£xg6† ¢h8 18.£h6† ¢g8 19.£xf4+–  White picks up the rook.


260. John Ryan – Emanuel Lasker, USA (simul) 1893
28...¥xf2†! 29.¢h1–+ Black soon won. Capturing the bishop leads to mate: 29.¦xf2 ¦c1† 
30.¦f1 £e3† 31.¢h1 ¦xf1 mate  or 29.¢xf2 £e3 mate .


261. Ostalaza – Emanuel Lasker, Havana 1893
12...¤xf4! 13.¥xf4 The game saw 13.¥b5µ (0–1, 35 moves). It’s important that 13.¤xc6 
¤xe2†µ  comes with check. 13...¤xd4–+  By opening the c-file, Black creates play against 
c3 and threatens to win the bishop pair. 13...¥xd4? 14.¤d5³ is not correct – one pawn is not so 
much in this type of position; active pieces and attacking chances carry more weight.


262. Emanuel Lasker – Celsito, Havana (simul) 1893
14...¤xe4! 15.¥xe4 15.0–0 £c5†! is important, as otherwise White would have great 
compensation for the missing pawn. 16.¢h1 ¤f2† 17.¦xf2 £xf2µ ; 15.£f3!?³ is a way to play 
on a pawn down. Another way is the game move 15.¥e3µ (1–0, 34 moves). 15...£h4† 16.¢f1 
£xe4–+  Now all talk of compensation can be dismissed.


263. Alfred Ettlinger – Emanuel Lasker, New York (1) 1893
16.¤xc6! bxc6 17.£xa6† ¢d7 18.£xa2  Instead of being a pawn down, White is a pawn 
up. Therefore, he can bear placing the queen on b1 after: 18...¦a8 19.£b1!± 19.£c4?! ¦a1† 
20.¤b1 f6²


264. Emanuel Lasker – Joseph Blackburne, Hastings 1895
20...¤xh2! 20...£h5! works as well: 21.h3 ¤g1! And White has to give up the exchange since 
22.¦ee1 ¤xh3–+ is Game Over. 21.¢xh2 21.£d3 ¤g4–+  protects the bishop thanks to the 
mate threat. Or 21...£h5–+. 21...£h5† 22.¢g1 £xe2–+ 


265. Harry Pillsbury – Emanuel Lasker, St Petersburg 1896
28...£c3†! 29.¢a4 b5†! 30.¢xb5 £c4† 31.¢a5 ¥d8† 32.£b6 So far, there was no other way 
to do it, but now Black has two moves. 32...¥xb6 mate  Or 32...axb6 mate.


266. Emanuel Lasker – N.N., Berlin (simul) 1897
1.£xf7†! 1.hxg7 £a2†! 2.£xa2 ¤xa2 and White is only probably winning. 1...¢xf7 2.¤e7† 
¥f3 3.¦xf3 mate 


267. Emanuel Lasker – Anderson, London (simul) 1898
7.¥xf7†! 7.£d5? is a double threat, but 7...£e7= defends. 7...¢xf7 8.£d5† ¢e8 9.£xc5± 


268. Emanuel Lasker – Joseph Blackburne, London 1899
31...¦h1†! 31...¥xg3? 32.¤xg3 £h4 33.fxg4 £xg3 threatens 34...¦h2 35.£e2 £h4 with mate, 
but 34.¦e3³ keeps the disadvantage to a minimum, as does 34.£f3³. 32.¢xh1 ¥xg3! 33.¤xg3 
33.¦e2 and Black has two ways: a) £h4† 34.¢g1 ¥h2† (or 34...¤f2–+) 35.¢h1 ¤f2† 36.¦xf2 
¥g3† 37.¢g1 ¥xf2 mate  b) 33...¤f2† 34.¢g1 (34.¦xf2 £h4† 35.¢g1 ¥xf2 mate) 34...¤xd1 
With an easily winning position. 33...¤f2† 34.¢g1 ¤xd1–+  White only gets a rook for the 
queen; there is no way to catch the knight on d1 without losing another piece.


269. Emanuel Lasker – N.N., Great Britain (simul) 1900
25.d4! The queen has no squares and 25...cxd4 26.¦xc8† ¤xc8 27.¤xh6+–  wins a piece.


270. Emanuel Lasker – R. Lee, Hereford (simul) 1900
1.¥xa6! bxa6 2.b5 axb5 3.axb5+–  White queens. But not 3.a5?? b4–+.


271. Emanuel Lasker – Manuel Marquez Sterling, Paris 1900
12.f5! The pawn sacrifice is good enough even on just positional grounds, but there is also a 
tactical follow-up. 12...gxf5 13.¥h6! 13.¤e7 £xa4 14.¤xf5 ¦g8! 15.¤xg7† ¦xg7 16.£xf6 £xc2 
gives some counterplay, although Black should not have enough for the piece after 17.¤c3 £xg2 
18.¦f1±. 13...0–0 13...¥xh6 14.£xf6  is a winning double attack and 13...bxc6 14.¥xg7+– was 
the game (1–0, 28 moves). 14.£g3 Other moves are interesting as well, so full points if you have 
seen any of the other lines instead: 14.¥g5 ¤e4 15.¤e7† is winning, as is 14.¥xg7 ¢xg7 15.g4!. 
Even the immediate 14.g4 seems to give White a winning position. 14...¤e8 15.¤e7†! £xe7 
16.¥xe8  f6+– White exchanged the “dead” knight on c6 for Black’s knight and is a piece up.


272. Emanuel Lasker – E.M. Sala, USA (simul) 1901
22...f2†! 23.¦xf2? 23.£xf2 ¤f3† 24.¢h1 ¤d2† 25.¢g1 ¤xf1µ  wins an exchange. 23...¦d1† 
Or 23...£h1† 24.¢xh1 ¦d1† with mate next move. 24.¦f1 £h1† Or 24...¦xf1† 25.¢xf1 
£h1†–+ 25.¢f2 25.¢xh1 ¦xf1 mate  25...£xf1† 26.¢e3 £f3 mate


273. M.R. Quinault – Emanuel Lasker, USA (simul) 1903
24...¦xh2†! 25.¢xh2 £h6† 25...¦h8†? 26.¢g1 £g6 allows White to almost escape: 27.¢f2 
¦h2 28.¢e1 ¤xg2† 29.¦xg2 ¦xg2 30.¦f2µ 26.¢g1 ¤h3† White must give up his queen, with 
a losing position. 27.¢h2 Black soon won after 27.£xh3 £xh3 . 27...¤g5†!–+ 


274. Emanuel Lasker – Rudolf Loman, USA (simul) 1903
39...¦h4! A beautiful and classic motif. 40.¢xh4 g5† 41.¢xg5 ¢g7–+


275. Emanuel Lasker – Ferenc Chalupetzky, corr. 1903
13.¥xc6†? bxc6 14.£xc6† ¢f7 15.£xa8 wins an exchange, but White loses: 15...exd4† 16.¢f2 
¥b7 and 17...£e4–+. The exercise was a red herring! If he captures on c6, White has to limit 
the damage with 15.£d5†! ¢g6 16.0–0!µ with two pawns for the piece. But the best move is: 
13.¥e2!  To avoid the check on h5, Black should exchange queens with 13...exd4 14.£xd4 
£b4† 15.£xb4 ¥xb4† 16.c3 when White has a slight advantage with fewer pawn islands. Other 
non-blundering 13th moves also give full points.


276. Edward Hymes – Emanuel Lasker, USA (simul) 1905
36...¦xh3†! Decisively opening up the king’s position. 37.gxh3 £xf3†!  38.¢h2 £g3† 
 
Or 38...¦g3 with mate in a few moves. 39.¢h1 f3 0–1 White resigned, as mate is on the way 
after 40.¦h2 f2.


277. E. Tarnowski – Emanuel Lasker, corr. 1908
22.¤xd6! 22.¥f4 would not spoil things enough to throw away the win, and 22.¦f1 hxg5 
23.¤xd6 still gives White a winning attack. 22...cxd6 23.£xd6† ¢b7 23...¢c8 24.£c5† 
transposes. 24.£d5†  1–0 Black cannot allow ¥e3†, £xe5† or £xa8†. So the only option was 
to resign.


278. Emanuel Lasker – Womersley, England (simul) 1908
1.d5! Another move order also works: 1.¥a6† ¢b8 2.d5! ¥d7 3.¥c4+– (or 3.dxc6 ¥xc6 4.¥c4+–) 
1...cxd5 1...¥xd5 2.¥a6† and one of the pawns will queen with check (or 2.¥xd5+–). 2.¥a6† 2.c6 
dxc4 3.b7† ¢b8 4.d7+– or 2.¥b3+– or 2.¥a2+– all also win. 2...¢b8 3.c6  1–0 White is mating.


279. Emanuel Lasker – N.N., Netherlands (simul) 1908
23.¤e6†! fxe6 24.¦xf4† ¢g8 24...¢e8 25.¥b5†+–  and 24...¥f6 25.¦xd8†+–  both fail to 
save Black. 25.¥xe6 mate 


280. Emanuel Lasker – N.B. Holmes, England (simul) 1908
23...¦xc2! 24.£xd6 24.£xc2 ¥f5–+; After the game move, there are many ways to win. The 
strongest is: 24...¦c1†! White loses the queen after: 25.¢xc1 ¦c8†–+ Another winning move is 
24...¥e6!?–+ with two threats: a discovered check on a2 and 25...¦xf2.


281. Emanuel Lasker – H.P
. Fortuin Harreman, Netherlands (simul) 1908
29.¤e7†! ¢h8 30.£xh7†! ¢xh7 31.¦h4 mate 


282. Emanuel Lasker – Joseph Blake, England (simul) 1908
White can exploit Black’s back-rank problems. 21.¦ad1! ¦f8 22.£d5†! 22.¦e8 eventually wins 
a piece, but the variations are complicated after 22...£xa2. If you saw a full line of the following 
you get full points: a) 23.h4 h6 24.¦dd8! ¦xe8 25.£xe8† ¢h7 26.h5!+– b) 23.h3 (23.f3 is 
similar) 23...h6 (23...h5 24.¦dd8! ¦xe8 25.£xe8† ¢h7 26.£xh5 mate) 24.g4!+– 22...¢h8 
23.£xf5!+– 


283. Coates/Wallwork – Emanuel Lasker, Manchester (simul) 1908
29...¤h3! 30.gxh3 Allowing the check on f2 is no alternative. 30...¥f3† Or with more flair: 
30...£f3† 31.¥xf3 ¥xf3 mate 31.¥xf3 £xf3 mate 


284. Siegbert Tarrasch – Emanuel Lasker, Germany (2) 1908
15.¥xg7! 15.¤h5!?± 15...¤xf2! 15...¢xg7 16.¤f5† ¢h8 17.£xg4+–  16.£d4!+– Retaining 
the bishop for the black knight leaves Black with a weaker king to take care of. The game instead 
continued 16.¢xf2 ¢xg7 17.¤f5† ¢h8 18.£d4†! f6±, when White can take on a7. However, 
the pawn is not the main thing he has achieved, but instead the tremendous difference between 
the minor pieces. However, Black managed to turn the game around and win, which would have 
been less likely if White had found the strongest 16th move.


285. Akiba Rubinstein – Emanuel Lasker, St Petersburg 1909
17.¦xc6†! bxc6 18.£c1± Not 18.£d2? ¦e5 and the undefended queen on d2 saves Black. In the 
game, White wins the whole rook and is a pawn up after: 18...¦xd4 19.fxe3 ¦d6 20.¦xf7± 


286. Julio Lynch – Emanuel Lasker, Buenos Aires (simul) 1910
30...¦xe2! 31.¦xe2 ¦b1†! Precise. 31...¤xf4 32.¦e1 ¤xd5 33.exd5† does not win a pawn, even 
though Black is better due to the pawn structure. 32.¢g2 ¤xf4† 33.¢f3 ¤xe2 34.¢xe2 ¦b2† 
35.¢f3 ¦xa2µ  White has decent drawing chances and managed to save himself in the game.


287. J. Bar – Emanuel Lasker, Germany (simul) 1913
30...¤xe5!³ Black wins back his pawn, as 31.dxe5? d4–+  threatens to win not one but both 
rooks, as well as the bishop. The game continued 31.¤g3 (1–0, 58 moves).


288. Vilhelm Nielsen – Emanuel Lasker, Copenhagen (simul) 1919
White can convert his positional advantage into a material advantage: 15.¥xh7†! ¢xh7 16.£d3† 
¢g8 17.£xd7±  (1–0, 41 moves)


289. Prusa – Emanuel Lasker, Prague (simul) 1924
White is much better, and can tactically increase his advantage. 19.£c3†! f6 20.¤xf6! ¦xf6 
21.¥xh6†! ¢xh6 21...¢f7 22.¤g5†+–  22.£xf6+–  Black cannot challenge White’s queen. 
There are many ways to win, among them the moves in the game: 22...¥d7 23.£f7 £g8 24.g5† 
The game ended here, and since it is mate-in-three it seems likely the supposed “0–1” result is a 
mistake.


290. Emanuel Lasker – Vrbasic, Yugoslavia (simul) 1924
1.a6! bxa6 2.¢d7!  1–0 Black cannot stop the pawn.


291. A. Arnold – Emanuel Lasker, Prague (simul) 1924
15.e6! fxe6 16.£h5† g6 17.£xc5+–  Black is lost and walked into another tactic: 17...0–0–0 
18.¥xe6 1–0


292. Alexander Alekhine – Emanuel Lasker, New York 1924
28...¤g5! 29.¤xg5 Alekhine’s 29.¤e5 fxe5 30.£xg5 e4–+  lost a piece. 29...£h2† 30.¢f1 
fxg5!–+  The double threat of 31...£xh3 and 31...£h1† 32.¢e2 £xg2 decides.


293. Emanuel Lasker – Kenneth Smith, USA (simul) 1926
White will soon regret putting baby in a (tight) corner! 15...¤g3†! 16.hxg3 hxg3†  The king 
is trapped, so White has to give back the bishop, when he will fall apart on the dark squares and 
h-file. 17.¥h2 ¦xh2† 18.¢g1–+ Black has already won a pawn and wins by moving the next 
rook to h8, or using the b6-g1 diagonal (0–1, 27 moves).


294. Muehrenberg – Emanuel Lasker, Copenhagen (simul) 1927
23.¥xd6! cxd6 23...¥c8 was played in the game (1–0, 42 moves). 24.¤xd6+–  Black’s queen 
cannot defend the bishop on d7 or rook on f7, so he loses an exchange.


295. Emanuel Lasker – Buchholtz, Copenhagen (simul) 1927
21.£d8†! £f8 22.¦xg7†! ¢xg7 23.£g5† ¢f7 24.£g6† ¢e7 25.¥g5†  White has a mating 
attack; the game concluded: 25...¤f6 26.¥xf6† £xf6 27.£xf6† ¢e8 28.¥g6 mate


296. Bruno Hartmann – Emanuel Lasker, Copenhagen (simul) 1927
24.¦e6!+–  There is no defence against 25.¥xh6; taking on e6 opens up for mate on h7. Instead 
after 24.¥xh6? ¦xe1† 25.¢f2 ¢g8! 26.¥f4 ¦fe7 White has only a perpetual: 27.£h7† ¢f7 28.£g6† 
¢g8=; 24.¦xe8? £xe8 25.¥xh6 is actually losing after: 25...£e1† 26.¥f1 ¢g8 27.¥f4 ¥h4!–+


297. A. Gavilan – Jose Raul Capablanca, Havana 1901
20...¥xh3! 21.gxh3 £xh3† 22.¢g1 £xg3†–+  The f2-pawn is pinned and White loses his 
knight on d3 (0–1, 39 moves).


298. Jose Raul Capablanca – Juan Antonio Blanco Jimenez, Havana 1901
47.h4! The only winning move. 47...¢f4 48.h5 ¢g5 49.¢f7!+–  Black is not in time to 
capture both pawns.


299. Jose Raul Capablanca – Rudolf Raubitschek, New York 1906
32.¦xa7†! £xa7 33.¦a5! It’s mate on the next move. The game ended: 33...£xa6 34.¦xa6 
mate 


300. Rudolf Raubitschek – Jose Raul Capablanca, New York 1906
24...¦xg2†! 25.¢f1 25.¦xg2 ¦xg2† 26.¢xg2 £xf6–+  wins the queen. 25...¥c4† 25...¦xf2† 
26.£xf2 ¥h3† is also mating, as is 25...¦g1† 26.¢e2 ¥c4†. 26.¤xc4 ¦g1 mate 


301. Albert Pulvermacher – Jose Raul Capablanca, New York 1907
10...¤xe4!–+ Black wins a piece, due to: 11.¥xd8 ¥f2 mate 


302. Jose Raul Capablanca – Edward Adams, Washington DC 1907
37...¥b4! The sacrifice could be postponed a move, but not longer – White’s king was on the way 
to defend with ¢g2-f3-e4-d3. 38.axb4 ¦xd1 39.¤xd1 a3  0–1 One of the pawns will queen. 


303. Jose Raul Capablanca – William Pratt, Troy (simul) 1909
17...¦d7! 17...¦d5? 18.g4! and White is only slightly worse. 18.¤xh8 ¦e7! Black wins the 
bishop on c1, with a devastating pin along the first rank. 19.g3 ¦e1† 20.¢g2 ¦xc1–+  
The game continued 21.d4 ¥d6 22.¤f7 h6 23.¤xd6† cxd6 24.¢f2 and Pratt won by collecting 
the kingside pawns while Capablanca released his knight (0–1, 43 moves).


304. Juan Corzo y Prinzipe – Jose Raul Capablanca, Havana 1909
9.¤xe5! 9.¤f6† is a move order that also works. 9...¥xd1 10.¤f6† ¢f8 Or 10...gxf6 11.¥xf7† ¢f8 
12.¥h6 mate . 11.¤ed7† 11.¤fd7† also forces Black to give back the queen. 11...£xd7 12.¤xd7† 
¢e8 13.¦xd1 ¢xd7 14.¥xf7±  White’s queen sacrifice won a pawn in the end (½–½, 76 moves). 
 
14.e5 might be slightly stronger, and a few other moves also give a clear advantage.


305. Jose Raul Capablanca – Einar Michelsen, New York 1910
27.£xd5†! ¢c7 27...¢e8 28.¦e1† is Game Over and 28.¤d6† also leads to mate. 28.£d6†!  
White is mating. 28...¢b6 29.¦b1† 29.¤fe7 and 29.¤ge7 are also winning. 29...¢a6 30.£a3† 
Other moves are mating as well. 30...¤a5 31.£d3†! 1–0 The only winning move, before Black 
creates an escape-square on b7.


306. O. Tuka – Jose Raul Capablanca, Prague (simul) 1911
25.¤xe4! 25.¤b3 is also winning for White, again winning either the bishop or the knight. In 
the game, Black can’t take back due to 25...£xe4 26.¥f3+–  and if he doesn’t take, then he loses 
the bishop on c5 or the knight on e7.


307. Jan Podhajsky – Jose Raul Capablanca, Prague (simul) 1911
21...£h3!–+  There is no defence against 22...¦xf2. Capablanca played 21...¦f3?! 22.¢g2 £g4 
and won after 23.¦h1 h5!–+ (0–1, 31 moves). However, 23.¦g1! h5 24.¢h2 would have held an 
equal position. 21...¦xf2? 22.¦xf2 £xg3† 23.¢h1 £xe3 24.¦g2 £xd4 25.¦xg5 hxg5÷ leads to 
a highly unusual position with five pawns for a rook.


308. Jose Raul Capablanca – Edward Tennenwurzel, New York 1911
17.¤xf7! ¢xf7 18.¦xe4! dxe4 Tennenwurzel played 18...¥c8  and Capablanca had several 
ways to win. The easiest is 19.f5, when Black still can’t take on g5 or e4, and other moves are 
just losing. 19...dxe4 (19...¥xg5 20.£h5†+– and White picks up almost everything) 20.¥c4† 
¥e6 21.£xh7! Not the only winning move, but the prettiest and strongest. 21...¤xh7 22.¤e5† 
¢g8 23.¥xe6† ¢h8 24.¤g6 mate) 19.¥c4† ¥d5 20.£f5†! ¢g8 21.¥xd5† Or 21.£xd5†+–. 
21...¢h8 Now, White wins with 22.¤e5 , either immediately, or after capturing on a8, e7 or 
e4.


309. Jose Raul Capablanca – William Morris, New York 1911
26.¦e7! £xe7 27.¤xf5+–  White not only threatens the queen, but also 28.¦xh7† ¢xh7 
29.£h5 mate.


310. Jose Raul Capablanca – J. Koksal, Prague (simul) 1911
22...¦xd3! 23.cxd3 ¦e2 The raking bishops together with the active rook give Black a winning 
attack. 24.d4 ¥xg2† 24...¥xd4 25.¥c3 gives some back-rank problems, but Black wins all the 
same after 25...¥xg2†! 26.¢h2 ¥c6†! 27.¢g3 ¥f2†! 28.¢g4 h5† 29.¢xh5 ¥f3† 30.¢g5 ¥e3† 
31.¢h4 ¦g2 with ...¥g5 mate coming. 25.¢h2 ¥c6† 26.¢g1 26.¢g3 is forced mate: 26...¥d6† 
27.¢h4 ¦e4† 28.¢h5 g6† 29.fxg6 hxg6† 30.¢g5 ¥e7† 31.¢h6 ¦h4 mate 26...¥xd4† 27.¢f1 
¥b5 28.¥c3 ¦xb2† 0–1


311. Jose Raul Capablanca – Rudolf Spielmann, San Sebastian 1911
28.¥f4! Developing with tempo and defending against the mate. 28...£d8 29.¦xe7!+–  
Black is mated, even after 29...£f8 30.£xg7†, as in the game (mate in 15).


312. Wilhelm Kluxen – Jose Raul Capablanca, Hamburg (simul) 1911
17.¤g6†! £xg6 17...hxg6 18.£h3† £h4 19.£xh4 mate  18.¥xg6 ¦xf5 19.¥xf5+–  
 
The knight is trapped, so White wins a piece. 19...g6 20.¥e4 1–0


313. Jose Raul Capablanca – Rolando Illa, Buenos Aires 1911
25.£d7†! ¦e7 26.¦xg7†! ¢xg7 27.£xe7† ¢h6 27...¦f7 28.£xf7†! ¢xf7 29.¦xb6 axb6  
White’s c-pawns are not impressive, but the outside passed pawn on the h-file secures the win. 
28.¦g1±  White has collected a second pawn and has good winning chances (1–0, 38 moves).


314. Leopold Carranza – Jose Raul Capablanca, Buenos Aires 1911
12...¥xc2! Capturing a pawn that’s defended twice. 13.¥xc2 ¤c4µ  Black wins back the piece 
with an extra pawn.


315. E. Weiss – Jose Raul Capablanca, Hamburg (simul) 1911
14.¦xg7†! ¢xg7 15.¥h6† ¢h8 16.£g5 ¤h5 17.¦g1!+–  There is no defence against 18.¥g7† 
followed by 19.¥f6†. Instead, 17.£xh5 is not easily winning due to 17...¤d7!. Even though 
White gets two pieces for a rook after 18.£xf7 ¦g8 19.£xd7 ¥xc3 20.bxc3 £xc3 21.£xd5±, 
Black has counterplay against the weak white king.


316. Charles Jaffe – Jose Raul Capablanca, New York 1912
9...exd4! By opening the e-file, Black prepares 10...¤xe4. 10.cxd4 10.¥xf6 ¤c5! (10...¥xf6µ) 
The knight move threatens to capture the queen with check, and Black wins the e-pawn after 
11.£xd4 ¥xf6–+ . 10...¤xe4–+  White has no compensation for the pawn (0–1, 31 moves).


317. Jose Raul Capablanca – N.N., Louisville (simul) 1912
18...¦xe5! 19.dxe5 19.£xe5 ¤d3†–+  forks queen and king. 19...¥d3  Black wins the 
knight and, with the extra pawns and a strong continued attack, he has a winning position. 
The game continued 19...¤d3†? 20.¢f1 £xb5 21.¥xa5 £xa5µ when Black is better, with 
two pawns and a better king for the exchange, but Capablanca later turned the game around 
 
(1–0, 42 moves).


318. Jose Raul Capablanca – Juan Corzo y Prinzipe, Havana 1913
24.¥xg6! hxg6? Black should have accepted the loss of a pawn after 24...¥f6, but any bishop-
retreat (b1, c2 or d3) gives White a huge advantage. For example: 25.¥b1 ¥xc3? 26.¦xe6! and 
White is winning even more material. 25.£xg6† ¢h8 26.¦xe6+–  Black has to give up a piece 
to prevent the heavy piece onslaught (1–0, 32 moves).


319. R. Portela – Jose Raul Capablanca, Havana 1913
35...¦xd3†! 36.¦xd3 e4† 37.¢e3 37.¢g3 ¦g4†! is important: 38.¢f2 exd3  with a winning 
rook or pawn ending. 37...¦h3†! 37...exd3? 38.¢xd3 ¦xh2³ allows counterplay on the 
queenside. 38.¦g3 38.¢d4 ¦xd3†  39.¢c4–+ and the e-pawn queens if Black keeps the rook 
on the d-file. 38...¦xg3† 39.hxg3 exd3 40.¢xd3 ¢g4  The endgame can be evaluated as won 
without much calculation. The rest is given anyway, just in case. 41.¢c4 ¢xg3 41...b6 is easier. 
42.¢c5 h5 43.¢b6 h4 44.¢xb7 h3 45.a5 h2 46.a6 h1=£ 47.a7 c5† 48.¢b8 £h8† 49.¢b7 
The remaining moves are strange in ChessBase. There are two ways to win: 
a) 49...£g7† 50.¢b8 £f8† 51.¢b7 £e7† 52.¢b8 £e8† 53.¢b7 £b5† 54.¢c7 £a6 55.¢b8 
£b6† 56.¢a8 c4! 57.bxc4 £c7 when White is not stalemated. 58.c5 £c8 mate; 
b) 49...£xb2 50.a8=£ £g2† 51.¢a7 £xa8† 52.¢xa8 ¢f4!–+ (but not 52...c4?? 53.bxc4 b3 
54.c5 b2 55.c6 b1=£ 56.c7 with a draw)


320. Jose Raul Capablanca – Fedor Duz-Khotimirsky, St Petersburg 1913
28.¤f5! fxe6 28...gxf5 29.£xf5  with unavoidable mate. Instead, the best defensive try is 
28...¢h8 29.£e4! (several other moves provide a clear advantage) 29...fxe6 30.¤xe7 £xe7 31.dxe6 
¤c3 32.£xd4† £g7, but White is winning all the same. 29.dxe6! £c7 29...£xf3 30.¤xe7†  wins 
a piece, but there is no tactical way to finish the game after 29...¦b8. However, there is no need for 
it; White is winning if he avoids the queen exchange. 30.£c6!  Not obligatory, but a precise move 
that wins the b-pawn (1–0, 47 moves). 30.£g4/g3 and 30.¤xe7† are also decent enough.


321. Jose Raul Capablanca – Richard Reti, Vienna 1914
33.¦c8†! ¢e7 34.b7 ¥xb7 35.¦c7† ¢e6 36.¦xb7+–  White won easily.


322. Jose Raul Capablanca – U. Kalske, Helsinki 1914
16...¦xf3! The two pieces are winning against the rook after whatever way White takes on f3. 
17.£xf3 ¤xg5–+ 


323. Jose Raul Capablanca – Masyutin, Kiev 1914
14.¤c4†! Or 14.¦xf6! gxf6 15.¤c4† dxc4 16.¤e4† ¢d5 17.¤xf6† ¢xd4 (17...¢d6 18.¤e4† 
¢d5 19.£h5† with mate) 18.¦d1† winning the queen. 14...dxc4 15.¤e4†  With a mating 
attack. 15...¢d5 16.¦f5† 16.¦xf6+– reaches the line above, and 16.£h5† wins as well. 16...¢xe4 
16...¢xd4 17.c3† ¢d3 18.¦f3† ¢c2 19.¦f2† ¢d3 20.¤c5† mate 17.¦e1† ¢xd4 18.c3† ¢d3 
19.¦d5 mate


324. Jose Raul Capablanca – Joseph Blackburne, St Petersburg 1914
White is winning after most moves, but can decide the game directly in a few moves: 28.¦xg7†! 
¢xg7 29.¦g1† ¢f8 30.£g6+–  White threatens both a mating attack and the rook (which 
cannot escape or be protected anyway).


325. Jose Raul Capablanca – Lynch/Villegas, Buenos Aires 1914
37.¤e6 ¢xd7 38.¤c5† ¢c6 39.¤xd3+–  And White won.


326. Jose Raul Capablanca – M. Wolfson, New York (simul) 1915
35...¦a2†! 36.¢xa2 £a4† Black resigned, as it’s mate: 37.¢b2 ¦e2† 38.¢c1 £c2 mate 


327. Jose Raul Capablanca – J.M. Stahr, Chicago 1915
33.¦xe6†!  33.£xf5† exf5 34.¦xc7 ¦xg2† is probably winning for White, but he only keeps 
one of his pawns. Better is giving up a rook for the most important defender of the black position. 
33...¢xe6 33...¢g5 34.¦d5+– pins the queen. 34.£c6† 34.£e2† £e5 35.£xc4† ¢f6 36.£f7† 
¢g5 37.¦xc7 also wins. 34...¢e5 35.¦d5† 1–0


328. Jose Raul Capablanca – Christoph Wolff, New York 1915
22...¦xe3! 23.fxe3 ¥xe3† If Black does not keep on the queens, White can safely continue with 
the counterplay on the queenside without fearing an attack: 23...£xe3†?! 24.£xe3 ¥xe3† 25.¢f1 
¥xc1 26.¤a4 ¥a3 27.¦a5 And White’s active pieces compensate for the material deficit. 24.¢h1 
¥xc1 Black has won two pawns, but Capablanca could have taken one back with 25.¤xd5! cxd5 
26.¦xc1µ  when White has drawing chances.


329. Walter Shipley – Jose Raul Capablanca, Philadelphia (simul) 1915
31...¦xf2! 32.¦xf2 ¤d3 The queen can’t defend both f2 and a1. But not 32...£xf2†?? 33.¢xf2 
¤d3† 34.¢e3 ¤xc1 35.¦xc1+–. 33.£d2 £xa1  34.¦e2 £d4† 0–1 White resigned, as he is 
two pawns down.


330. Manfred Schroeder – Jose Raul Capablanca, New York 1916
16...¥g3†! 17.hxg3 17.¢f1 ¤f2–+  with a fork. 17...£xg3† 18.¢d2 ¤f2–+  The queen 
can’t defend the rook, and that’s only one of White’s problems.


331. Jose Raul Capablanca – Marc Fonaroff, New York 1918
20.¤h6†! ¢h8 21.£xe5! £xe5 22.¤xf7†!+–  Black is mated or loses a piece.


332. Jose Raul Capablanca – Walter Shipley, Philadelphia (simul) 1918
32...¤xa3†! 33.¦xa3 33.bxa3 £xc3!  and White dearly misses his b-pawn. 33...¦xb2†! The 
game continued 33...¥xa3? 34.¤xb5! £xb5² when Black was a pawn up, but Capablanca showed 
that the h-pawn is worth more than that. 34.£xb2 ¥xa3 35.£b3 ¦xh6µ Now Black is two 
pawns up, although White has some counter-chances due to Black’s misplaced rook. However, 
note that he can’t play: 36.£g8† ¢c7 37.£g7† ¢b6 38.£xh6 £b4† 39.¢a2 £b2 mate 


333. Harold Cole – Jose Raul Capablanca, Hastings 1919
29...¥xf5! 29...¤xe4 30.¤xe4 £xe4 31.£xe4 ¦xe4 32.¥h6 leaves White with some hope. 
30.£xf5 30.exf5 £e1† 31.£f1 £xc3–+  also gives a position with two pawns extra. 30...£xc3  
0–1 There is nothing dangerous happening on g7 due to the exposed white king, so the material 
advantage is decisive.


334. Jose Raul Capablanca – Boris Kostic, Havana (3) 1919
White already has two pawns, but Black threatens 29...¥xe1 and 29...¦d4. There is a solution to 
both of the threats: 29.¦e8! ¦d4 29...¦xe8 30.¦xe8† £xe8 31.£xd5  wins, since Black can’t 
exploit the first rank. 30.¦xf8† Or 30.£e6. 30...¥xf8 31.£e6  White keeps both pawns with 
a serious advantage. 31.£c1 is equally strong.


335. Jose Raul Capablanca – Edward Tinsley, London (simul) 1919
17.¤h6†! gxh6 17...¢h8 18.¤xe4+–  leaves White a piece up. 18.¤xe4 Threatening 19.¤f6†. 
The only defence is taking it, but after 18...¦xe4 19.£xe4+–  the compensation is clearly 
insufficient. The black king is open, his pawns are weak, and f4-f5 can be annoying at some point 
if Black does not further weaken himself with ...f7-f5.


336. Jose Raul Capablanca – T. Bray, Birmingham (simul) 1919
12.¤xf7! 12.¤e5! ¤xe5 13.dxe5 winning a piece, also gives full points, but only if you saw: 
13...£d5 14.£f1! The knight cannot move due to 15.¥e4 winning the b7-bishop. 12...¥xf3 
12...¢xf7 13.¤g5† ¢f8 (or 13...¢g8 14.£xe6† ¢h8 15.¤f7† ¢g8 16.¤h6† ¢h8 17.£g8† 
¦xg8 18.¤f7 mate ) 14.¤xe6†+–  A fork on the king and the queen. 13.gxf3 Also strong is 
13.£xe6 threatening mate, and 13...¥d5 14.¤xd8† ¥xe6 15.¤xe6 leaves White two pawns up 
with a positional advantage to boot. 13...¢xf7 14.£xe6† ¢f8 15.¥c4  1–0 There is no defence.


337. Jose Raul Capablanca – Valentin Marin y Llovet, Barcelona (simul) 1920
White has a pawn for the exchange, and with the king on b1 there would be hope. But 26...¦xa2†! 
27.£xa2 ¦a6–+ is brutal. The game ended: 28.£xa6 £xa6†  29.¢b1 £d3† 0–1


338. Jose Raul Capablanca – M. Coll, Barcelona (simul) 1920
16.¤xf7! ¢xf7 The game continuation was 16...£c7 17.£xe6 ¥f8 18.¤xh6† ¢h8 19.£g8† 
¤xg8 20.¤f7 mate. 17.£xe6† ¢f8 18.¥g6  Mate is unavoidable.


339. Jose Raul Capablanca – E.S. Maddock, New York (simul) 1922
25.¤xf6! ¥xf3 26.¥xf3! 26.¤xd7 ¥xe2 27.¤xe5 ¥xd1† 28.¢xd1 f6 is only slightly better 
for White, as the pawn on d3 falls. 26...£d6 27.¥xe5  White can also start with 27.¥xb7†. 
27...£b6+– The point is 27...£xe5 28.¥xb7† ¢b8 29.¤c6†+–  with a fork. 28.¤xb7? Easier 
was 28.¥xb7† ¢b8 29.¤c6† ¢xb7 30.¤xd8† with too many pieces for the queen, and a decisive 
attack. 28...c4! Black threatens both 29...£xb3† and 29...£f2†, but Capablanca would still have 
been close to winning if he had played: 29.d4 £xb3† 30.¢d2 £b2† 31.¢e3 £xc3† 32.¢f2 
Instead, the game continued 29.¤xd8 (1–0, 37 moves) but here Black could have drawn with 
29...£f2† 30.¦d2 cxd3† 31.¢c1 £e1† 32.¦d1 £e3† 33.¦d2 £e1†.


340. Jose Raul Capablanca – Perkins, New York (simul) 1924
20...f4! 21.¦xh8 21.gxf4 exf4 22.¥xf4 ¤d4† 23.¢e3 and Black picks up an exchange with a 
winning position after 23...¤xc2† . 21...¦xh8 22.gxf4 22.¤ce4 fxe3–+ was the hopeless game 
continuation (0–1, 27 moves). 22...exf4 23.¥xf4 ¤d4†–+  White loses the rook.


341. Efim Bogoljubov – Jose Raul Capablanca, New York 1924
Black has two not-so-strong pawns extra, but can increase his lead with: 31...¤xd4! 32.cxd4 
¦8xc5! 0–1 33.¦xc4 ¦xc4–+  moves the rook away from the threat, and White loses the rook 
on c1 after 33.dxc5 £xc5† 34.¢f1 ¦xc1–+ .


342. Frank Marshall – Jose Raul Capablanca, New York 1927
31...¦d5! 32.£f3 32.£c4 ¤e5 and the queen can no longer defend the rook on f1. 
 
32...¤e5  The black pieces swarming around the white king will win the queen in one of 
several ways, for instance: 33.£f2 ¦xf1† 33...¤d3 34.£f3 ¦xf1† 35.£xf1 ¤xb2 was another 
way to win. 34.£xf1 ¤g4!–+ Black threatens 35...¤e3 and 35...¦d1 36.£xd1 ¤f2†.


343. Jose Raul Capablanca – A. Souza Campos, Sao Paulo 1927
20.¦h3†! ¢g8 21.¤xf6†! ¢f8 21...gxf6 22.¥xf6  with mate on h8. 22.¦h8†  ¢e7 There 
are now several ways to mate. 23.¦e8† 23.¤g8† ¢e8 24.¤h6† followed by 25.¥(x)f7 mate is 
equally fast. 23...¦xe8 24.¦xd7† ¢f8 25.¦xf7 mate


344. Jose Raul Capablanca – C.H. Reid, London 1928
17...¦xh4†! The move order 17...¥xg2 works as well, as 18.¤xg2 loses to 18...h4. But 17...¦hg8 
18.¥h3! is not as clear, although probably still winning after 18...f5. 18.gxh4 ¥xg2 19.¢xg2 
19.fxe5 was the hopeless game continuation: 19...£h3† 20.¢g1 ¥xf1 and White resigned. 
19...£g4† 20.¢f2 £xh4†  20...¤d4 21.¥xd4 £xf4† also wins. 21.¢f3 White has to give up 
several pieces to avoid mate after for example: 21...¤d4† 22.¢e4 f5† 23.¢d5 £f6–+


345. Jose Raul Capablanca – Gracie Square Pharmacy Chess Club, New York (simul) 1931
37.f6†! Black has to take on f6 to defend the g6-pawn. 37...¦fxf6 38.¤h5† ¢h7? No better is 
38...¢h8 39.£h6† ¢g8 40.£g7 mate . Black had to play 38...¢f7 39.¦xf6† ¦xf6 40.£xf6† 
¢e8. Without rooks, he threatens both 41...bxa2 and a lot of checks. The trick is to take on 
g6, defend the f1-square and the e4-pawn with check, and then take on b3: 41.£xg6†  ¢d8 
42.£f6† ¢c7 43.£f4† ¢b7 44.axb3+– 39.¤xf6†  White can take care of the black counter-
threats in more than one way, for instance: 39...¢g7 40.¤h5† ¢h7 41.£e7† ¢h6 42.¤g3+– 
The knight moves back to g3.


346. Jose Raul Capablanca – Glicco, Mexico 1933
17.¥xf7†! ¢h7 17...£xf7 18.¤xh6†+–  A fork. 17...¢xf7 18.£b3† ¢e8 (or 18...¤d5 
19.exd5 gxf5 20.dxc6†  ¢g7 21.cxd7 ¥xd7 22.¤xe5+– with three pawns more) 19.£e6† £e7 
 
20.£xe7 mate  18.¥xg6†! ¢xg6 19.dxe5+–  20.e6 and 21.e7 or 21.¤e5 wins material 
wherever Black moves the knight.


347. Jose Raul Capablanca – George Thomas, Hastings 1934
24...£a5–+  A double threat against the bishop and knight. Thomas started with 24...¦xd2?! 
25.¦xd2 before playing 25...£a5. He was winning, and won, but there was little reason to give 
away the exchange. Perhaps he feared the knight coming to d6, but apart from giving up the 
exchange when that happens, he could also win with: 25.¤c4 ¦xd1! 26.¦xd1 26.¤xa5 ¦xe1† 
27.¥f1 ¥a6–+ 26...£xb5 27.¤d6 £d7 When all is well and safe.


348. Jose Raul Capablanca – Llusa, Barcelona (simul) 1935
19.£xh7† 19.¦xf4? ¦xf4–+ 19...¢f7 20.¦xf4†! £xf4 21.¦f1 £xf1† 22.¥xf1+–  Black has 
no chance of surviving, with his poor development and weak king. Or 22.¢xf1+–.


349. Jose Raul Capablanca – Andor Lilienthal, Moscow 1936
35.¤xb7! ¦xb7 35...¤xc4! is the best defence. White is a pawn up after 36.¥xc6†± but there is 
work left to do to convert. 36.¥xc6† ¦d7+–  It is possible to imagine a situation where Black 
blockades the queenside pawns, but it is not realistic with careful play. Best is the game move: 
37.c5 (1–0, 54 moves)


350. Jose Raul Capablanca – J.C. Rather, New York (simul) 1936
18.¤xd5! £xd5 No better are 18...¤xd5 19.¦xh7† ¢xh7 20.¦h1 mate  or 18...¦g8 19.¤xf6! 
¦xg5 20.¦xh7 mate . 19.¦xh7†! ¤xh7 19...¢xh7 20.¦h1†  with mate. 20.£xd5+–  1–0


351. V. Malkov – Alexander Alekhine, corr. 1902
21.¦h7†! ¢xh7 22.£h5† ¢g8 22...¢g7 23.£h6†  ¢g8 24.¦h1 with mate. 23.¥xg6 There 
are other ways to win, but this is the cleanest. 23...fxg6 24.£xg6† ¢h8 25.¦h1 mate 


352. Alexander Alekhine – Nikolay Zubakin, corr. 1902
White’s king seems reasonably safe in the centre, but with 19...¦xd4†! Black exposes it to the 
deadly onslaught of his entire army. 20.exd4 ¥f4† 21.¢d1 £xd4† 22.£d3 £xd3 mate 


353. Alexander Alekhine – S. Antushev, corr. 1903
14.¤xe5! ¥xd1 The game went 14...¤xe5 15.£xh5+– . 15.¥xf7† ¢f8 16.¤xc6 This wins 
back the queen. Also good is the long but forcing variation 16.¥d5† ¢e8 17.¥xc6† ¢e7 18.¤g6† 
¢e6 19.¥d5† ¢d7 20.¦f7† ¢c8 21.¤e7† £xe7 22.¦xe7±. 16...£d7 17.¥e6†±  White is two 
pawns up and has good winning chances.


354. Alexander Alekhine – V. Zhukovsky, corr. 1905
27...¤f2! Zhukovsky played 27...£b5†? when strongest is 28.c4!÷ to open the third rank for the 
queen. 27...¤h2†? 28.¢g1 ¤f3† also fails to win after: 29.¢h1 ¦g8! (threatening 30...£xh3† 
31.hxg3 g2 mate) 30.¥xg3! ¦xg3 31.£f8†= It’s almost a perpetual, and if not then White can 
defend the knight on h3. 28.¢g1 28.¥xg3 ¤xh3! 29.gxh3 £f3†  leads to mate, as does 
28.¤xf2 £e2† 29.¢g1 £e1† 30.¦xe1 ¦xe1 mate . 28...¤xh3†! 29.gxh3 £xh3!  White will 
be mated. 29...£e2 30.¥xg3 £e3† 31.¢h2 £f3! 32.¦e1 ¦d8! is also mating.


355. V.M. Manko – Alexander Alekhine, corr. 1906
25.¤xh7! 25.¦xh7†! gives the same result. 25...¦xh7 26.¦xh7† ¢xh7 27.£xc7† ¢h6 
28.¦d8+–  Or 28.£xb8+–, or even 28.h4+–.


356. Alexander Alekhine – Otto Kunze, Düsseldorf 1908
23.¥xg6! ¤xg6 24.£xe6† ¢h8 25.£xg6  White threatens 26.¦f7 or moving the queen with 
check followed by g5-g6. It is a forced mate. The game ended with: 25...£c6 26.£h5† ¢g8 
27.£f7† ¢h8 28.g6 d4† 29.¤d5 1–0


357. Alexander Alekhine – H. Koehnlein, Düsseldorf 1908
16.£xd6! 16.¤f7† ¦xf7 17.¥xf7 ¥d7+– is not quite as good. 16...cxd6 17.¤f7† ¦xf7 18.¦e8† 
¦f8 19.¦xf8 mate 


358. Alexander Alekhine – Dawid Daniuszewski, St Petersburg 1909
Black is positionally winning and after 34...£xg6! 35.fxg6 ¦xf1–+  he also wins material. 
White’s queen cannot escape. The double threat with 34...£c4 picks up a pawn, and if you are 
100% sure you would win this, you can give yourself full points (hand on your heart!).


359. Alexander Alekhine – Savielly Tartakower, Hamburg 1910
21.¤d5†! ¢e8 21...exd5 22.¦ae1†+–  followed by 23.¦xf8. 22.¤xc7† ¢e7 23.¤d5† 
 
¢e8±  The knight retreats to e3, with or without the exchange on f8.


360. Alexander Alekhine – Krotky, Tula (simul) 1910
20.¦xf7! £xf7 21.¤b6† axb6 22.¥xf7  If Black had time to move the knight and take on h4, 
he would have compensation for the exchange. But there is no hope after: 22...¤f6 23.hxg5+–


361. Alexander Alekhine – Gutkevitsch, Moscow (simul) 1910
14.¥h6! 14.¤xg7? ¢xg7 15.¥h6† ¢h8 is not mating. 14...¤e8 14...gxh6 15.£xh6+–  
threatens mate both on g7 and h7. The best defence was 14...g6, since Black gets the bishop pair 
if White takes the exchange. But 15.¤g7! puts an end to that dream. 15.¥xg7! An important 
move – otherwise 14.¥h6 makes no sense. 15...¤xg7 16.£h6+– 


362. Ossip Bernstein – Alexander Alekhine, Vilnius 1912
21...¤xc3! 22.¥xg6 22.£xc3 ¥xe4–+  is over, and Black wins an exchange after 22.¥xa8 
¤xb1–+  (not 22...¤xd1?! 23.¥f3µ and the knight is trapped). After the game move, there are 
many ways to win: capturing a rook or creating a double threat against g2 and g5. Alekhine chose: 
22...£d5 23.¥xh7† ¢h8 24.f4 ¤xb1 25.¦xb1 £xd4†–+


363. Alexander Alekhine – Boris Koyalovich, St Petersburg 1912
34...¥d4! Black defends against 35.£f6† or 35.£xh8†. 35.¦xd4 ¥xc4†! 36.¢f2 No salvation is 
offered by 36.¦xc4 £xc4†–+  or 36.¢g2 ¥f1†–+. 36...¦h2†! The king will be forced to a light 
square, allowing the bishop to move with check. 37.¢g3 37.¦g2 ¦e2† (or 37...¦xg2† 38.¢xg2 
¥f1† 39.¢xf1 £xc3–+) 38.¥xe2 £xg2† 39.¢e3 £xe2 mate  37...¦h3†! The only winning 
move. 38.¢xh3 ¥f1†! 39.¦xf1 £xc3–+ 


364. Dawid Janowski – Alexander Alekhine, Scheveningen 1913
16.¤cd6†! White wins the exchange or the queen with a discovered attack. 16...¥xd6 17.¤c7† 
¦xc7 18.£xa6+– 


365. Alexander Alekhine – Efim Bogoljubov, St Petersburg 1913
21...¦xf2! 22.¥xf7† The two captures are hit hard: 22.¦xf2 ¦e1† 23.¦f1 ¦xf1 mate  and 
22.£xf4 ¦xg2 mate . 22...¢h8!  White is still mated if he captures the rook or the queen, 
and 23.¦d1 £xf7–+ also gave no hope (0–1, 27 moves). Or 23...¦xg2†–+.


366. Sergey Lebedev – Alexander Alekhine, St Petersburg 1914
23...¦c2! White has three ways to defend against 24...¦xb2, but none helps. 24.¦xc2 
a) 24.¤c4 ¥xf4 25.exf4 £d4!–+  Black does not have to exploit the pin. Next is 26...¥xf3. 
b) 24.¤xd3 ¦xc1† (24...¥d6–+ also wins a piece) 25.¤xc1 a5!–+  The knight on d2 is lost. 
24...dxc2†–+  25.¢xc2 Black is not in a hurry, but there is a way to end the game that’s easier 
than the others: 25...¦c8† 26.¢b1 Or 26.¢d1 ¥xf3† mating. 26...a5!–+ The next move is 
27...£xd2.


367. Dawid Janowski – Alexander Alekhine, Mannheim 1914
40.¦g8†! The rook sacrifice ensures that the next moves come with check. 40.¦h7†? ¢xh7 
41.£xe4† ¦f5 42.¥xd6 £xf3² gives counterplay with the d4-pawn alive. 40...¦xg8 41.£xd4†! 
¢h7 42.£xe4† ¦g6 42...¢h8 and White wins by taking on d6 now or after a few checks. 
43.¥xd6+–  Exchanging first was also winning. The rook is no match for the connected passed 
pawns supported by the bishop.


368. Nikolay Tselikov – Alexander Alekhine, Moscow 1915
28...¦xg2†! 29.¢xg2 d4†–+  29...¦g8† is also mating in various ways, and 29...£g4† as well 
as 29...¥g5 are also winning. 30.¥e4 The point of 29...d4† is shown after 30...¦g8† 31.¢f1 
£xf4† when White can’t defend the check with £f2. One way to end the game is: 32.¢e2 
£xe4† 33.¢d1 £d3 mate


369. Alexander Alekhine – Feldt, Tarnopol (blindfold simul) 1916
15.¤f7! 15.¤c6 ¥xc6 16.£xe6† ¢h8 17.£xc6+– wins a pawn (one point). 15...¢xf7 
16.£xe6†! ¢g6 16...¢xe6 17.¤g5 mate  is over, and Black has to give up too much to avoid 
mate after 16...¢f8 17.¤g5+– . 17.g4 18.¥xf5 mate and 18.¤h4 mate are two threats Black 
can’t defend against. Also mating are 17.¥xf5† ¢h5 18.g4† ¤xg4 19.¥xg4 mate and 17.¤h4† 
¢h5 18.£xf5†, with mate on the next move. 17...¥e4 18.¤h4 mate 


370. Alexander Alekhine – Vasiutinsky, Odessa (simul) 1918
14.¤xf7! Black castled here (1–0, 28 moves). 14...¢xf7 15.£xe6† ¢f8 16.£xe7†+– 


371. Nikolay Pavlov-Pianov – Alexander Alekhine, Moscow 1919
27...£xh2†! 27...£xg4† 28.¦g2 £xf5µ leaves White fighting. 28.¢xh2 ¤xg4† 29.¢g3 ¤xe3–+  
Black takes on f5 and wins two pawns and an exchange with no counterplay left for White.


372. Alexander Alekhine – Nikolay Grigoriev, Moscow 1919
23.¤xf7!  ¢xf7 White also wins a pawn after 23...¥xf7 24.¥xf7± (24.¦xe7±). 24.¦xe6 
24.¥xe6†± is good enough, but the text move is stronger. 24...¤d5 25.¦e7†+– (1–0, 36 moves)


373. Ilya Rabinovich – Alexander Alekhine, Moscow 1920
17...¤xc4!µ Black wins a pawn due to: 18.£xc4 d5 19.£b5 a6!–+  The only good move.


374. Alexander Alekhine – G. Resser, The Hague (simul) 1921
35.£f6†! ¢e8 36.e6! White does not have to move with check – Black’s counterplay is too 
slow. 36...£f5! A strong defence, forcing White to find the only way to win. 36...£g6 37.exf7† 
(or 37.£h8† ¢e7 38.¥c5†!+–) 37...£xf7 38.¦e6† ¢f8 39.£xh6†+– And Black must give 
up the queen for the rook (or 39.£h8†+–). 37.exf7† ¢f8 38.¥c5†! ¦xc5 39.£xd8† ¢xf7 
 
40.¦b7†!  1–0 Black will be mated.


375. Joaquin Torres Caravaca – Alexander Alekhine, Spain (simul) 1922
26...¥xd4 26...¦xd4 gives the same outcome: 27.¦xd4 (27.¤xd4 £xh3–+) 27...¥xd4 28.¤xd4 
£xh3–+ 27.¦xd4 27.¤xd4 £xh3! 28.gxh3 ¤f2† 29.¢g1 ¤xh3 mate  27...¦xd4 28.¤xd4 
£xh3! 29.gxh3 ¤f2† 30.¢g1 ¤xh3 mate 


376. Alexander Alekhine – Frederick Yates, Hastings 1922
Black is almost getting mated, and can take a perpetual check, but more can be achieved: 
38...¦8c3†! 38...¦1c3† makes no difference. 39.bxc3 ¦xc3† 40.¥d3 £f1†! 41.¢e3 ¦xd3† 
42.£xd3 £xd3† 43.¢xd3 ¢xf7–+  White’s ruined pawn structure makes him a hopeless 
victim.


377. Alexander Alekhine – N.N., Berlin 1922
18.¤xc6!± White won a pawn due to: 18...¥xc6 19.¦xc6 ¦xc6 20.£xe4 dxe4 21.¦xd8+– 


378. Alexander Alekhine – Manuel Golmayo de la Torriente, Spain 1922
32.f6! 32.¥xd7? ¦xd7 33.£e5 is a triple threat (34.£xb2, 34.£xc5 and 34.£e8† ¥f8 35.£xd7) 
but 33...¦dd2!= defends, because of 34.£xc5?? ¦h2† 35.¢g1 ¦bg2 mate. 32...gxf6 32...¤xf6 
33.£b8†+–  is over. After the game move, the open g-file can be exploited in several ways. 
Alekhine chose: 33.¥xd7 ¦xd7 34.£g4†+–


379. Siegbert Tarrasch – Alexander Alekhine, Bad Pistyan 1922
24...¤g3†! 25.¢g1 Or 25.fxg3 £xg3–+  with a decisive double threat. After the king move, 
White is still not threatening to take on g3, and there are many ways to add fuel to the attack: 
 
a) 25...¥c8–+ followed by 26...¥xh3; b) 25...d2–+ wins an exchange, to start with. Alekhine 
started with 25...¥d5 and won convincingly (0–1, 38 moves).


380. Alexander Alekhine – Heinrich Wolf, Bad Pistyan 1922
White has a winning position, and can finish the game forcefully: 22.¦xe6! fxe6 23.¤g5+–  
The threats are too numerous. 23...¤c5 This defends e6 for the moment, but Black loses the 
knight when White moves the queen. After 23...£c8 or 23...£b8, White has a winning attack 
with a combination of ¤g5xe6, ¦e1 and d6xe7. There is no need to calculate a concrete variation.


381. Alexander Alekhine – Frederick Yates, Portsmouth 1923
23.f3! Wherever the knight moves, White takes on d6 and e8. The game continuation was: 
23...¤d2 24.¦xd6 £xd6 25.£xe8†+– 


382. Alexander Alekhine – Lester Samuels, New York (simul) 1923
26.¦xa7! £d5 26...¢xa7 27.£a3† (or 27.b6† ¢a6 28.¦c5! with mate after 28...¦a8 29.£b4!) 
27...¢b6 28.£c5†  With mate in a few moves. 27.£a2! Alekhine played 27.¦a2? ¦c8!±. 
27...£xg2† 27...£xc4 28.¦a8† ¢c7 29.£xc4†+–  28.£xg2 hxg2 29.b6 ¦c8 The only defence 
against 30.¦c7. 30.¦ca4+–  To avoid mate, Black has to part with a rook.


383. Alexander Alekhine – Reib, Prague (simul) 1923
17.¥g5!  Black has to take, as otherwise he is a piece down. 17...£xg5 18.¤e4 18.£xa8+– 
wins and 18.¤xf7!+– gains an extra pawn. 18...£f4 19.£xa8 ¤d6+– The knight is lost here, 
but White is still winning.


384. Alexander Alekhine – Menzel, Boston (simul) 1923
29.¦a8†! ¤xa8 After 29...¤e8 White has two immediate ways to exploit the eighth rank: 
 
a) 30.¥c5 £xb7 31.¦xe8† ¦f8 32.¦xf8 mate or b) 30.¤d7 with a double threat. Or 29...¦f8 
30.¦xf8† ¢xf8 31.£b8† picks up a piece on c7, as 31...¤e8 32.¥c5†+– wins the queen. 30.£c8† 
Black resigned due to: 30...¦f8 31.£xe6†! ¢h8 32.¤f7† ¢g8 32...¦xf7 loses to 33.£c8†  
with back-rank mate. 33.¤h6† Or 33.¤d6†+– winning the queen. 33...¢h8 34.£g8† ¦xg8 
35.¤f7 mate 


385. Alexander Alekhine – John Drewitt, Portsmouth 1923
20.¥xh7†! ¢xh7 21.¦h3† ¢g8 22.£h5! Simplest and best. The game continued 22.¥xg7?! 
f6 23.¥h6, which is a more complicated way to win. 23...£h7 24.£h5 ¥f8 25.£g4† ¢f7 
26.¥xf8+– wins back the sacrificed piece, keeping the g- and h-pawns. 22...f6 23.¥xa3 £xa3 
24.£h8† ¢f7 25.£xd8 £c1† 26.¤f1+– 


386. Siegbert Tarrasch – Alexander Alekhine, Karlsbad 1923
Black has a good position, but faces the threat of 35.¦xd4 £xd4 36.£f8 mate. 34...¥e3! 35.fxe3 
Tarrasch played 35.¦f1 but when White is forced into passivity, Black can do whatever he wishes 
with a winning position (0–1, 54 moves). 35...£xh2† 36.¢f1 £h1 mate  Or 36...£f2 mate.


387. Alexander Alekhine – Herman Steiner, New York (simul) 1924
33...¦xh2†! 34.¢xh2 ¤f3† 35.¢g2 ¤xd4µ  Black lost despite his extra pawn.


388. Alexander Alekhine – Leon Kussman, New York (simul) 1924
16.£b5†! ¤d7 16...£xb5 17.¤f6 mate  17.¦fe1!+–  There is no defence against the discovered 
attack. 17.¤f6† £xf6 18.¦ae1† ¥e7 19.¦xe7† ¢f8 20.£b4! is also winning, as is 17.¦ae1!.


389. Alexander Alekhine – J.Y. Downman, USA (simul) 1924
19.¦h6! gxh6 20.¥f6† White can also play 20.¤f6+– or 20.£xh6 ¦g8 21.¤f6 ¦g7 22.¤xd7+–. 
 
20...¤xf6 20...¢g8 21.¤e7†+– wins the queen. 21.¤xf6 £e7 22.£xh6 £xf6 23.£xf6† 
¢g8+–  Black has two rooks for the queen but his king has no hope against h3-h4-h5-h6, and 
he soon resigned.


390. Alexander Alekhine – F. Casciato, USA (simul) 1924
20.¦xe5! 20.¥xd7† ¢xd7 21.¦xe5 transposes. 20...£xh5 21.¥xd7† ¢xd7 22.¦xh5+–  The 
rook survived with the help of a lifeline – after the exchange on h5 it moves away from the threat.


391. Walter Michel – Alexander Alekhine, Basel (simul) 1925
21.¤f5! gxh5 21...gxf5 22.£xf5† ¦g6 23.¥xc6 ¥xc6 24.¦xc6±  gives White an extra pawn, 
but was Black’s only hope. 22.¤xe7† f5 23.¥xc6+–  White wins a piece, and he could also 
have gone for an exchange with 23.¤xf5 ¦e6 24.¤d6† ¦xe4 25.¤xe4+–.


392. Alexander Alekhine – H.A. Woher, Amsterdam (simul) 1925
30...£f4†! 31.¢g1 ¤xh3†! 32.gxh3 £g3†! 32...£xf3 33.£xa7= is only a draw. 33.¢h1 
£xf3†–+  After one or two more checks, Black takes on a6. If White then captures on f7, Black 
picks up the e5-pawn.


393. Alexander Alekhine – A.H.M. Wap, Rotterdam (simul) 1925
19.£c3! 19.¥xd4? £xd4 20.¦d1 £f6!÷ 19...c5 20.b4!+– Black’s rook is undermined, and he has 
no time for 20...f6 as 21.bxc5  comes with a double threat.


394. Alexander Alekhine – Anna Stephan, Czechoslovakia (simul) 1925
19.d6†! ¢h8 19...¥e6 20.¥xe6† £xe6 21.¤xe6  ¤xd2 22.¦d3+– wins an exchange. 20.¤g6†! 
hxg6 21.¦h3 mate 


395. Alexander Alekhine – Harold Lommer, Geneva (simul) 1925
33.¥xg7! ¤xg7 33...¦xh6 34.¦f8† ¢h7 35.¦h8 mate  34.¦f8†! Alekhine played 34.¦xg7†? 
£xg7 35.£xe6†=. White is a piece down, but the open black king is enough to draw the game. 
34...¢xf8 35.£h8† ¢e7 36.¦xg7 mate 


396. Alexander Alekhine – Walter Henneberger, Basel (simul) 1925
22...¤xc5! 23.dxc5 Alekhine tried to keep the loss to a pawn with 23.¥d6 but to no avail: 
23...¦xc3! (23...¥h4† 24.g3 ¥d8 is also winning, while 23...£xd2† 24.¢xd2 ¤b3† 25.¢c2 
¤xc1 26.¥xa3 ¦xa3 27.¦xc1µ might be what many would settle for) 24.¦xc3 (24.£xc3 ¦a2!–+) 
24...¦a1†–+ Black has a winning attack. However, you do not have to see all that to take on c5. 
23...¥xc3–+ 


397. Alexander Alekhine – Moriz Henneberger, Basel (simul) 1925
16.¥h6! ¤f5 16...gxh6 17.¤f6†+–  with a fork. 17.¥xf5 ¦xe1† 18.¦xe1 £xf5 19.¤xg7 
£xc2+–  Black won his pawn back, but his king position is in ruins.


398. Alexander Alekhine – Karl Gilg, Czechoslovakia (simul) 1925
32...¤xf5! The only move that gives Black an advantage. 33.¤xh7 33.gxf5 ¦xf5† 34.¤f3 ¦ef8–+  
33...¦f7!–+ Precise, but it was also good enough to take back on h7.


399. Alexander Alekhine – Edgard Colle, Paris 1925
30.£xd7! ¦xd7 31.¦e8† Not 31.¦c8†?? ¦d8–+. 31...¢h7 32.¦cc8  There is no defence since 
the queen cannot safely move with check.


400. Alexander Alekhine – Saint Germain, Paris (simul) 1925
16.£xc6! £xc6 Black made things worse with 16...¦d7? 17.£xd7†+–. 17.¤ce5† fxe5 18.¤xe5† 
¢f6 19.¦xc6+–  White wins a second pawn on c7. 19.¤xc6 is equally strong.


401. Alexander Alekhine – Peter Potemkin, Paris (simul) 1925
21.¦exe6†! Or 21.¦axe6†! but not 21.£f3?! 0–0 22.¤b6 £d6 23.¦d1 £xb6 24.¦xb6 axb6 
when Black is fighting, or 21.¤b6?! £xd1 22.¦xd1 ¦d8! 23.¦xd8† ¢xd8 24.¦xa7 ¦e8 when 
White’s knight is in trouble. 21...fxe6 22.¦xe6†! ¢f7 22...£xe6 23.¤c7†  is similar. 23.¦e7† 
£xe7 24.¤xe7 ¢xe7+–  Black’s two rooks are still on their initial squares and White’s queen 
has time to collect a second pawn.


402. Alexander Alekhine – N. Schwartz, London (simul) 1926
25.¥xg6†! 25.¤xg6?! dxe4! 26.¤xe7 is not as good after 26...¥xg4 27.£xe4† ¥f5 28.¤xf5 £xf5 
29.£xb7† ¢h8±, even though the extra pawn and the active rooks might be enough. 25...¤xg6 
26.¤xg6 ¢g8 26...£xg6 27.¦e7†+–  wins the queen. 27.¤xf8+–


403. Alexander Alekhine – Raul Molina, Buenos Aires 1926
28...¦xb2†! 29.£xb2 29.¦xb2 £d1† 30.£c1 £xc1 mate  29...¤xb2–+ 

30...¦e2! 31.¦xe2 ¦xe2 32.£xe2 Alekhine gave up a rook with 32.¦f5–+ (0–1, 37 moves). 
32...£h3† 33.£h2 £xf1† 34.£g1 £xg1 mate 


405. Alexander Alekhine – Colman Lerner, Buenos Aires 1926
14.d5!+–  There is no defence against 15.¥xb6 £xb6 16.£a4†, with a winning attack. Alekhine 
won a pawn with 14.¤xc4 ¤xc4 15.£a4† £d7 16.£xc4² but the bishop pair and the long 
diagonal gave some compensation.


406. Alexander Alekhine – Carmichael, Newcastle upon Tyne (simul) 1926
16.¥xh6†! ¢g8 16...¢xh6 17.£e3† ¢g7 18.£g5† ¢h8 19.£h6† ¢g8 20.¦e5!  with mate. 
17.¤e5!+–  Black can’t defend against the attack, even though it takes a few moves before it is over.


407. Alexander Alekhine – Rudolf Spielmann, Semmering 1926
23...¦xc3! 24.bxc3 ¤xe4  25.¦d4 25.¦c2 ¤xf2 26.¦d4 tries to hold onto the exchange, 
but Black has a winning attack after 26...£b1†  (the positional 26...¤e4 is also winning) 
27.¢h2 £h1† 28.¢g3 £e1 29.¢h2 ¤e4 and 30...¦f1. 25...¦xf2!–+ White cannot defend c3 
in a good way. Spielmann played 25...¤xc3?!µ which wins back the exchange or the pawn on f2. 
Surprisingly, he agreed to a draw a few moves later.


408. Frederick Yates – Alexander Alekhine, Kecskemet 1927
24.¦d8†! Yates started with 24.¤h6? but it allowed 24...£c8!. Best is now 25.¦g4!± with an 
initiative. About equal is 25.¤xf7 exd4= while the game continuation was 25.¦d8† £xd8 
26.¦xd8† ¦xd8 27.¤xf7 ¢xf7÷ (0–1, 75 moves). 24...¦xd8 25.¦xd8† ¢e7 26.¤h6! gxh6 
26...£xc2 27.¦e8†! ¢d6 28.¤xf7†+–  27.£g8+–  Black’s king cannot escape, so he must 
give up lots of material to avoid mate.


409. Alexander Alekhine – Aron Nimzowitsch, New York 1927
22.¤xc5! It doesn’t matter how Black takes back. 22...¤xc5 23.¦d6+– 


410. Alexander Alekhine – Carbonell, Barcelona (simul) 1928
19.¥xc5! £xc5 20.b4! The queen cannot keep defending the knight on e5. 20...£xb4 
21.¦xe5+– 


411. Alexander Alekhine – Efim Bogoljubov, Berlin (13) 1929
31...£e4!–+ A double threat against e1 and a4. 32.¦xe4 ¦c1† 33.¦e1 ¦xe1 mate 


412. Efim Bogoljubov – Alexander Alekhine, The Hague (18) 1929
37.¦xc7†! 37.£xe6 ¥xh2 38.£xg4 also wins a pawn and should be winning, but Black still has 
hope. 37...£xc7 38.¤c5† ¢b6 39.£xc7† ¢xc7 40.¤xe6† ¢d7 41.¤xd8 ¢xd8  1–0 It’s an 
easily winning endgame.


413. Alexander Alekhine – Mayerhofer, Regensburg 1930
28...¤xd4! 29.cxd4 Alekhine’s 29.¤b7 should not help, but he held a draw. 29...£xd4†–+  
Black takes back the piece and has several extra pawns and the safer king.


414. Alexander Alekhine – Salo Flohr, Bled 1931
28.e5! 28.¦c8 £d6 29.e5! also wins, but requires some variations: a) 29...£f8 30.¦c7; b) 29...£d7 
30.¦c6; c) 29...£e7 30.exf6 £xf6 31.¦xd8† £xd8 32.£xe6† ¢g7 33.£xa6 28...f5? 28...fxe5 
29.¦c8! £d6 30.¦c6+–  and the pawn sacrifice opened up lines for the f3-bishop. 29.¦c8! The 
d6-square is no longer available for the queen. 29...£xe3 30.¦xd8† ¢f7 31.fxe3+– 


415. Alexander Alekhine – Edgard Colle, Bled 1931
31.¥xd6 £xd6 32.¥xf5!+–  Black cannot take back on f5, nor can he allow White to penetrate 
on h7.


416. Alexander Alekhine – Nate Grossman, New York (simul) 1932
25...¦xg3! 26.hxg3 ¤g4! 27.¤f4 There is no miraculous rescue after 27.fxg4 £xg2 mate  or 
27.£f4 £h5† 28.¢g1 £h2 mate . 27...¤xe3–+  Black gets two bishops for a rook and is 
winning no matter how he takes back on d5.


417. Alexander Alekhine – L. Castaneda, Guadalajara (simul) 1932
12...¥xf3! 12...£h4† 13.¢e2 ¥h5! also wins due to the threat of 14...¤g3†. 13.gxf3 £xf3 
14.¦g1 14.dxe6 fxe6 gives no counterplay. 14...£f2† 15.¢d1 £xg1–+ 


418. Schut Bueters – Alexander Alekhine, Surabaya (simul) 1933
28...¤xf5! The e4-pawn is pinned. Not 28...¤f3†? 29.¢c2 ¤xg1 30.¦xg1 ¤xf5 31.£e2² and 
the bishop on g2 is trapped. 29.exf5 ¥xd5–+ 


419. Alexander Alekhine – Lista, Bratislava (simul) 1933
The knight checks its way to h6: 21.¤g6†! ¢h7 22.¤e5†! ¢h8 22...¥e4 23.¥xe4†  ¤xe4 
24.£xe8+– 23.¤f7† ¢g8 24.¤xh6† ¢h8 25.£g8† ¤xg8 26.¤f7 mate 


420. Alexander Alekhine – W.J. Haeften, Jakarta (simul) 1933
14.f5! Opening the e-file. 14...exf5 15.¤xg6 fxg6 16.£xe7+– 
 
421. Alexander Alekhine – Fricis Apsenieks, Folkestone (ol) 1933
12.¥g6! fxg6 12...¤xe5 13.¤xe5 does not change anything since the game move 13...¦c7 could 
be met by 14.¥a5!  with a winning attack (1–0, 23 moves). 14.¥xf7†, before or after a4xb5, 
might be winning too. 13.£xg6†  ¢e7 White has many ways to win. 14.¥b4† The simplest 
to calculate might be 14.¤f7 £e8 15.¤xh8+–. 14...c5 15.dxc5 Black is busted, for example: 
15...¤xc5 16.£f7† ¢d6 17.£xb7+–


422. Alexander Alekhine – Hoelsder, Amsterdam (simul) 1933
16.¤e5! 16.g6? £xg6 17.¤e5 is almost winning, but Black has: 17...£xh5! 18.¦xh5 dxe5µ 
16...dxe5 17.g6! 17.£c4? would have been a blunder after, for example, 17...£xc4 18.g6 £f1† 
19.¦xf1 ¥e8–+. 17...£xg6 18.£c4† ¦f7 19.¦h8 mate 


423. Hermann Joss – Alexander Alekhine, Zurich 1934
37...¦xc1! 37...£b2–+ is also winning, but Black has to calculate or find a lot more moves. 
For instance, all Black’s moves in the following line are the only winning ones: 38.¤d3 £b3! 
39.¤df4 e5! 40.dxe5 £b4†! 41.¢f2 ¦d2! 42.£xd2 £xd2–+ 38.¤xc1 38.£xc1 £xe2 mate  
38...£g2!–+  The rook has no squares.


424. Alexander Alekhine – Efim Bogoljubov, Germany (2) 1934
White is a piece up, but must solve the threats against e2, e1 and g2. 29.¦c8†! ¢f7 29...¥xc8 
30.£xe5+–  30.£h5†+–  White’s attack is mating, and there are so many ways that it does 
not make sense to give every line. Two other moves would also have forced immediate resignation: 
30.¦c7† ¢g6 31.¦xg7† ¢xg7 32.£xe5†+– and 30.¦f8† ¢xf8 31.¤d7†+–.


425. Alexander Alekhine – Efim Bogoljubov, Germany (16) 1934
30.e6! ¦dxg7 31.¤xg7 ¦xg7 32.¦xd5! Or 32.¦f8† first. 32...cxd5 33.¦f8† ¢c7 34.¦f7†+– 
Black must give up the rook, as 34...¦xf7? 35.exf7  queens.


426. Alexander Alekhine – Rafael Llorens, Barcelona (simul) 1935
19...¤xe3! 20.£c3 20.¢xe3 £xd4 mate  20...¤g4† Or 20...¤xc4 21.¥xc4 ¥xc4 (Instead 
Llorens played: 21...¦xd4? 22.¥e2± Black has no good discovered check and Alekhine won after: 
22...¥c4? 23.a5+– [1–0, 25 moves]) 22.£xc4 ¦xd4÷ With about enough pawns for the piece. 
21.¥xg4 fxg4÷  Black keeps the pawn, although the opposite-coloured bishops give White fair 
compensation. However, Black’s best was clearly to take on e3, since it would be so passive to 
retreat with the knight, when White would have enjoyed a clear advantage.


427. Alexander Alekhine – Jan Foltys, Podebrady 1936
22.¤xe6! 22.¦xb7± is strong enough for half a point. 22...fxe6 23.£g4† ¢h8 24.¦xb7 Black 
has to give up the knight on c4 to defend against the mate, so White wins a pawn. 24...¦c7 
 
25.¦xc7  £xc7 26.¥xc4!+– Keeping the queens on with the weak black king in mind. However, 
since the alternative is also good, you do not need to make that decision before playing 22.¤xe6.


428. William Winter – Alexander Alekhine, Nottingham 1936
26...¤c4! Black gets access to the e3-square with a winning position if White does not take. 
27.bxc4 £a4†  27...dxc4 and only then ...£a4† also gives a winning attack. The text move is 
strongest though. 28.¢c1 ¥a3† 29.¢b1 ¦b6† It will soon be mate. 


429. Alexander Alekhine – C.H.O’D. Alexander, Nottingham 1936
22.¥xf5! gxf5 The game saw 22...¢h8+– (1–0, 27 moves). 23.¤xf5 £h8 The only square that 
doesn’t move into a fork. 24.¤h6† Other moves are also winning, thanks to this weak square. 
24...¢g7 25.£g5 mate 


430. Savielly Tartakower – Alexander Alekhine, Nottingham 1936
29...¤h2! The knight continues to f3 if White does not take. 30.£xh2 ¦g4† Or 30...£f3 
followed by 31...¦g4†. 31.¢h1 ¦h4–+  Black wins the queen.


431. Alexander Alekhine – Endre Steiner, Kemeri 1937
14.d6! ¥xd6 15.¤f5!+–  The bishop is trapped.


432. Alexander Alekhine – Samuel Reshevsky, Kemeri 1937
35.¦xb8†! ¢xb8 36.£xe5†!  Black resigned, as he will be mated.


433. Alexander Alekhine – Max Euwe, Netherlands (14) 1937
34.¦xf5! ¦xf5 Euwe played 34...¦cf6+– (1–0, 52 moves). 35.¦xe8†  With a winning attack. 
After 35...¢f7 the easiest win is: 36.£e7† ¢g6 37.¥xe4+–


434. Eliashoff/Kahn/Ros – Alexander Alekhine, Nice 1938
25...¦xf3!–+ Deflecting the important defender on g2. 26.gxf3? £h3! 27.¦g1 £xf3† 28.¦g2 
£xg2 mate 


435. Vladimirs Petrovs – Alexander Alekhine, Margate 1938
31.b4†! ¢xb4 32.¦b7†!  After two precise moves, there are several ways that lead to mate or 
a decisive material gain. 32...¢c3 32...¢c5 33.¦b5 mate 33.¤e4† ¢c2 34.¦bb1 1–0 35.¦dc1 
mate is inevitable.


436. Alexander Alekhine – Olivera, Montevideo 1939
22.¦xb7!±  White wins a pawn, since Black cannot take a rook without losing the other with 
check. 22.¦xe8† ¦xe8 23.¦xb7 would allow sufficient counterplay after, for instance, 23...g6 
with the idea ...¦e2.


437. Alexander Alekhine – Arrais, Lisbon (simul) 1940
9.¤xe5! ¤xe5 9...¥xd1 10.¥xf7 mate  10.£xh5+– 


438. Alexander Alekhine – A. Amores, Lisbon (simul) 1940
28.¤c5! £f7 28...£xd4 29.¤e6+–  gives no salvation. 29.¤e6!+–  A double attack on f8 
and g7.


439. Max Bluemich – Alexander Alekhine, Krakow/Warsaw 1941
30...f4! Opening the fifth rank for the queen. 31.gxf4 31.¤c2 ¤h4! (31...¤h2† is also strong: 
32.¢g1 £f5–+ picking up the rook, or 32...£e2–+, or even 32...£b5–+.) 32.gxh4 £e2†! 
33.¢g1 £xd3–+  31...£b5! 32.c4 32.¢e2 £xd3† (or 32...¤e1! 33.¢xe1 £xd3) 33.¢xd3 
¤e1† 34.¢d2 ¤xg2–+  32...£xc4!–+  The knight is pinned.


440. Herbert Weil – Alexander Alekhine, Lublin/Warsaw/Krakow 1942
22...¤d4! Opening up for the rook to enter on the second rank. 23.exd4 23.£d1 loses to 
23...¦c1 and other moves. 23...¦c2! 24.¤c4 24.£d1 ¦xb2–+ , or 24...£e6† 25.¢f1 ¦xb2–+. 
24...¦xa2 Or 24...£e6† 25.¤e5 ¦xg2–+ when Black wins back the piece and White’s king 
cannot escape. (Alekhine’s 25...fxe5 was even stronger, but only since White couldn’t castle – he 
had already moved his king.) 25.£d1 ¦a1–+  Or 25...£e6† 26.¢f1 £a6–+.


441. Alexander Alekhine – Kurt Paul Richter, Munich 1942
20.¤e4! A simple fork, but Black has some counterplay. 20...£g6! 20...£e7 defends the 
 
b7-bishop, but 21.¤xd6 ¤d4 22.£e5 wins – Black needed the queen on the g-file. 
 
21.¤xd6  21.¥h5? ¦d5! 22.£xd5 exd5 23.¥xg6 fxe4² with some compensation. 21...¤d4 
Time for another exercise: 22.¥xb7! Also possible is: 22.¤f7†?! £xf7 (22...¢g8 23.¤e5!±) 
23.£e5 ¤xf3† 24.gxf3² 22...¤xb5 23.¤xb5+–


442. Alexander Alekhine – Klaus Junge, Lublin/Warsaw/Krakow 1942
26.¥xf7† Or 26.£g5† ¢h8 27.£f6† ¢g8 28.¦xd8 ¦xd8 29.¥xf7†+–. 26...£xf7 26...¦xf7 
27.£g5†+–  with a fork, while 26...¢xf7 27.£xh7†  wins the queen. 27.¦xd8 ¦xd8 Instead 
the game ended: 27...¤a4 28.b3 1–0 28.£g5†+– 


443. Alexander Alekhine – Efim Bogoljubov, Salzburg 1943
17.¤f5! ¥xf5 17...¦xd1 18.¤xe7† ¢f7 19.¦xd1 ¢xe7  wins White an exchange, as does 
17...£f7 18.£xd5±  (or 18.¤e7†±). 18.£xd5†±  (½–½, 44 moves)


444. Alexander Alekhine – Ruzena Sucha, Prague 1943
28.¦xd5!  exd5 29.¤d6+– The threats against c8, e8, f7 and d5 are too much for Black.


445. Jaromir Florian – Alexander Alekhine, Prague 1943
30...¦xb2! 31.¢xb2 Florian played on a pawn down: 31.£e4–+ (0–1, 43 moves) 31...£b4† 
32.¢c1 £xc3† 33.£c2 £a1† Or 33...¦f1† first. 34.£b1 ¦f1†–+  Black wins the queen.


446. Francesco Lupi – Alexander Alekhine, Sabadell 1945
37...¥xf3! 38.¥e1 The h-pawn is unstoppable after 38.gxf3 h3–+. 38...¥xg2 39.¥xh4 Black 
wins not only a second pawn, but also a third, after (for example) Alekhine’s 39...e5–+ which was 
enough to make White resign.


447. Max Euwe – Richard Reti, Amsterdam (1) 1920
19...¥xg2†! 20.¢xg2 £g4† Or 20...£f2† 21.¢h3 £f3† 22.¢h4 ¥f2† with a mating attack 
(22...g5† also mates). 21.¢f1 £f3† 21...£xd1† is also good enough. 22.¢e1 £f2 mate 


448. Max Euwe – Henri Weenink, Amsterdam 1920
22.¤e7†! ¦xe7 Weenink gave up the exchange with: 22...¢f8 23.£xf7† (or 23.¤xc6+–) 
23...¢xf7 24.¤xc6+–  23.¦d8† ¦e8 24.¦xe8 mate 


449. Max Euwe – Ernst Grünfeld, Gothenburg 1920
28.¥d5†! cxd5 29.¦xd5 White enjoys an extra passed pawn, but with opposite-coloured bishops, 
he needs to use his king to break the blockade; Black has decent drawing chances. 29...¥f5!? 
In the game, a draw was prematurely agreed after 29...¢f7 30.¦xd6. 30.¦xd6  ¥b1² Black 
restores the material balance, but it allows White to advance his passed pawn.


450. Max Euwe – Adolf Olland, Amsterdam (match) 1921
15...f4! Black wins a piece. 16.gxf4 16.£xf4 ¥xh3–+  16...£xh4  17.f5! White has some 
counterplay, but Black is still clearly better.


451. Max Euwe – Adolf Olland, Amsterdam (match) 1921
23.¦xf6†! Opening up the king’s position. 23...¢xf6 24.¦f1† Or 24.£g5† ¢f7 25.£f4† ¢e7 
26.£c7† ¥d7 27.¥g5†+–. 24...¥f5 24...¢e7 25.¥g5 mate 25.£d7!  White has two threats: 
26.¥g7 mate and 26.¥g5† ¢e5 27.¥f4† ¢f6 (27...¢e4 28.¤g3 mate) 28.g5 mate. It’s not possible 
to defend against both. Instead, Euwe drew after 25.gxf5? £xe2 26.£d6† ¢f7 27.£d5† ¢f6=.


452. Max Euwe – H.V. von Hartingsvelt, Amsterdam 1922
25.¥xf5! ¦xh3 26.¥xh3±  The bishop is saved by a lifeline, and White won a pawn (the 
 
e5-pawn was lost anyway).


453. Max Euwe – Rudolf Spielmann, Bad Pistyan 1922
24...¦xf4! 25.¢xf4 25.¦xf4 £e1† 26.¦f2 26...f4†–+  followed by 27...£xf2 (or 26...¤e5 
with a winning attack). 25...¤e5–+  A double threat: 26...¤xd3 and 26...¤g6†. (There is also 
nothing wrong with 25...£e4† 26.¢g5 £xd3–+ or 25...£d6† 26.¢g5 f6†!–+ winning a rook.)


454. Sturm – Max Euwe, Amsterdam 1923
24...¦xf2! 25.¦xf2 Sturm gave up a piece with: 25.¥xe4 £xd4–+ (0–1, 39 moves) 25...e3 
26.¦e2 exd2 27.¦xe5–+  Black has good winning chances after either recapture. White’s 
kingside pawns have no defenders.


455. Max Euwe – Jacques Davidson, Amsterdam (9) 1924
18.d6! £b8 18...¥xd6 19.¥xb7 £xb7 20.£xd6+–  19.d7 ¦d8 20.¤c6!+–  White wins an 
exchange.


456. Willem Schelfhout – Max Euwe, Amsterdam 1927
13...¥xd4! 14.exd4 £xd4† 15.¢h2 £xa1–+  Black is an exchange up, and White does not 
win a piece with 16.bxa5 due to: 16...e3–+


457. Max Euwe – Sonnenburg, Amsterdam 1927
9.¤xf7! ¢xf7 10.£f3† The king does not want to go to the e-file, but the alternatives are 
even worse. 10...¢e7 a) 10...¢g6 11.¥d3† ¥f5 12.£xf5 mate; b) 10...¢g8 11.¦xe6! £xe6 
 
12.£xd5  (mating), or 12.¥xd5 (winning). 11.¥xd5  White has a huge advantage due to 
the exposed black king, but it is not easily winning. The best line for both seems to be 11...¤e5 
12.£h5 £xd5 13.¦xe5 £c6+– when White should develop a piece and then adjust his attacking 
ideas depending on Black’s reply.


458. Max Euwe – Valentin Marin y Llovet, London (ol) 1927
25.¥xd5! exd5 26.£xd5† ¢f8 26...¢e8 27.£xh5†+–  wins a piece. 27.£xh5  There is only 
one way to defend both the bishop on h7 and the knight on g4. 27...¤h6 28.¥d6!+– Black has 
two pieces for a rook, but fighting against three pawns with a weak king is far too much.


459. Edgard Colle – Max Euwe, Amsterdam (1) 1928
26.¦xf7! ¦e8± White is satisfied to restore material equality. Both players have passed pawns, 
but only White has active heavy pieces, attacking the queenside pawns. White should not trade 
off his active rook as he did in the game (0–1, 35 moves) and instead either push the e-pawn 
(best) or take the b-pawn either immediately or after the intermediate 27.£e7. Instead 26...¦xf7 
27.£c8†  is mate.


460. Milan Vidmar Sr. – Max Euwe, Karlsbad 1929
34.¦e8†! ¥f8 34...¢h7 35.£d3†+–  wins the rook. 35.¦xf8†! ¢xf8 36.¤f5†! Euwe resigned 
here. 36...¢g8 37.£f8†! 37.¦d8†? ¢h7 38.¦h8† ¢g6! and White has to fight for a draw after 
exchanging queens, for example: 39.¤h4† ¢h5 40.£f3† £xf3† 41.¤xf3 ¦xb2³ 37...¢xf8 
38.¦d8 mate 


461. Frederick Yates – Max Euwe, Hastings 1930
33...¦dxe3! 34.¦xe3 ¦xh3† The queen is suddenly undefended. 35.¦xh3 £xf2–+ 


462. Max Euwe – A.A. Abdul Satar, Indonesia (simul) 1930
34.¦e6! ¥xe6 35.¤xe6+–  Black must give up the queen to avoid mate.


463. Max Euwe – Salo Landau, Amsterdam (4) 1931
26.¤xf5! White wins a pawn. 26...exf5 26...¦xf5 27.¥xe4+–  27.¦xd5+– 


464. Max Euwe – Eduard Spanjaard, The Hague 1932
29...¤e2†! 30.¢h1 ¤g3†! 31.hxg3 £xf1†–+  32.¢h2 £xf2! Or 32...¥e1 33.¥xf8 ¥xf2–+ 
with the same idea as the game continuation. 32...¦d8 33.£e7 ¦xd6 34.£xd6 £xf2 is also 
winning, but not as convincingly. 33.¥xf8 ¥xe3! Instead the game turned around after 
33...¢xf8?? 34.¤d7† when it suddenly is White who gives mate: 34...¢g8 35.£c8† ¢h7 
36.¤f8† ¢g8 37.¤g6† ¢h7 38.¤e7! 1–0 The capture on e3 forces checkmate, for example: 
34.£b8 £g1† 35.¢h3 £h1† 36.¢g4 £d1† 37.¢h4 g5† 38.¢h3 £h5 mate


465. Max Euwe – G. Boersma, Rotterdam (simul) 1933
18...¦xd3! 19.¦xd3 19.£xd3 £xg2 mate  19...¥xg2† 20.¢g1 20.£xg2 £xd3–+  Black is a 
pawn up, and with White’s open king, it is a decisive advantage. 20...¥xf1  21.£xf1–+ White 
kept control over the d-file, however he can do nothing active since he must defend his e-pawn.


466. William Felderhof – Max Euwe, The Hague/Leiden/Scheveningen 1933
White has dangerous threats against the uncastled black king, so Black gives up a piece to get to 
safety, and then continue with his own attack. 16...¥a3! 17.bxa3 The best move. In the game, 
White was too kind with 17.£a4?, as there was no reason to allow Black to keep the piece with 
17...¥xb2+–. Also bad is 17.¦xd7? ¥xb2†! 18.¥xb2 £xb2†–+  when White does not win 
anything on d7, since his king will obstruct the d-file. 17...0–0!µ  Black has a promising attack 
with threats such as ...¦fc8 and ...£xa3†.


467. Max Euwe – Alexander Alekhine, Zurich 1934
31.¤f7! £e8 31...¢xf7 32.£h5†! ¢e7 33.¦xe6† ¢xe6 34.¦e1†! with forced mate: 34...¢d6 
35.£c5† ¢d7 36.£f5† ¢d6 37.£e6 mate  32.¦xe6! £xe6 33.¤d8!  White wins the pawn 
on c6 with good winning chances.


468. Max Euwe – Alexander Alekhine, Netherlands (14) 1935
10.¦xh7! ¢xh7 Alekhine played the unchallenging 10...f5+–. 11.£h5† ¢g8 12.¥xg6+–  
The only defence against mate is to give up a whole rook.


469. Efim Bogoljubov – Max Euwe, Zandvoort 1936
37.¦xa2! ¥xa2 38.£a4+–  A double threat, and the pieces cannot defend each other.


470. Max Euwe – Theodore Tylor, Nottingham 1936
17.¦xc5! As simple as it looks; the bishop on e7 is pinned. But 17.¥c2?! £e6 18.¥f5 £d6!± 
does not win a pawn. 17...¥xg5 White won smoothly after: 17...¥xc5 18.¥xd8±  (1–0, 25 
moves) 18.¤xg5!  18.¦c7± is also a pawn up. 18...£e7 A double threat, but there are many 
remedies. We will give the easiest solution for a human as the main line and three alternatives. 
19.¥xd5 a) 19.£h5 h6 20.£xf7† £xf7 21.¤xf7 ¢xf7 22.¦c7† ¦d7 23.¦xb7 ¦xb7 24.¥xd5† 
¢f6 25.¥xb7+– with three extra pawns. b) 19.£c2 £xg5 20.¥xd5 ¥xd5 21.¦cxd5+– and Black 
loses due to the back-rank problems. c) 19.¤xf7 and White continues with a capture on d5, 
after which the rook on a8 is in trouble. 19...¢xf7 (19...£xf7 20.¦dxd5! ¥xd5 21.¥xd5 ¦xd5 
22.¦c8†+–) 20.¦cxd5 ¦xd5 21.¥xd5† ¥xd5 22.£h5†! ¢f8 23.£xd5 ¦a7 24.£f5† (but not 
24.£d8†? £e8²) 24...¢g8 25.£c8†+– 19...¥xd5 20.¦cxd5+– The knight on g5 is defended.


471. Fritz Sämisch – Max Euwe, Bad Nauheim 1937
36...¦g3†! 36...¦d3 also defends against the mate, but is a tempo and thus a pawn worse. 
37.¦xd3 £c2† 38.¢g1 £xd3 39.£xe5µ 37.¢xg3 £e3† Or 37...£c3†. 38.£f3 £xd2–+  
Black exchanges queens or wins the e4-pawn with check.


472. Alexander Alekhine – Max Euwe, Netherlands (6) 1937
7.¤xb5! ¥a6 7...cxb5 8.¥d5+–  8.£b3!+– 8.£xd4 £xd4 9.¤fxd4 is also good enough – Black 
can’t take on b5 due to the same reason as before, but White should avoid 8.¤a3? ¥xa3 9.¥xa6 
¥b4+–. In the game, he is ready to rescue the knight. 8...¥xb5 Euwe played: 8...£e7 9.0–0 (1–0, 
23 moves) 9.¥xf7† ¢d7  The black king is a decisive factor – no more moves are needed.


473. Max Euwe – Siegfried van Mindeno, Amsterdam 1938
White has a winning advantage after any queen retreat, but can decide the game in a few 
moves by going the other way. 30.£f7†! ¦xf7 31.¦xf7† ¢d8 32.¦d1†! ¢c8 33.¦xc7† ¢xc7 
 
34.¦d7†  1–0 The active rook together with the light-squared bishop and passed pawns spells 
the end.


474. Max Euwe – Salo Flohr, Netherlands 1938
30.¥e4†! ¢h8 30...¤xe4 unblocks the route to the f5-square: 31.£f5† ¢g8 32.£xc8†+–  
31.¤g6† 31.£xb7 is also winning. 31...¢h7 32.¤e7†+–  White takes on c8.


475. Max Euwe – Nicolaas Cortlever, Beverwijk 1940
11.¤c4!+– 1–0 Both black knights are hanging and 11...¤xc4 12.¥xd5†  or 12.£xd5† comes 
with check and picks up the second knight.


476. Max Euwe – Haije Kramer, Netherlands (3) 1941
27.¥xf7†! 27.¦c1 would be winning, if it were not for: 27...£g3†! (27...¦c8 28.¥xf7†! or 
27...¦e5 28.¥d5!) 28.fxg3 ¥xd4† 29.¢g2 ¦e2† 30.¢f3 ¦e3† With perpetual check. 27...£xf7 
27...¢xf7 28.£d5†  with mate. 28.£xc5±  The point behind White’s little combination 
was to exchange bishops to keep his king safe. He is still a pawn up when Black captures on f5, 
although the isolated bishop on h6 gives Black compensation. If you evaluated this position as 
dangerous for White and deliberately allowed the draw, you also get full points.


477. Efim Bogoljubov – Max Euwe, Karlsbad (5) 1941
23...¦xf3†! 24.£xf3 24.gxf3 ¥h3† 25.¦g2 £xg2 mate  24...£h1†! Not 24...¥xf3? 25.gxf3÷ 
and Black is happy if the g- and h-pawns hold the balance, since White has rook and two bishops 
for the queen. 25.¢e2 £xg2†! That’s it – Black keeps his bishop. 26.¢d3 £xf3–+ 


478. Efim Bogoljubov – Max Euwe, Karlsbad (1) 1941
25...¤g3! 26.¤xg3 ¥xf4† 27.¢c2 ¥xg3³ Black has won a pawn and White cannot take it 
back, since 28.¥xh7? g6–+  loses the bishop.


479. Arnoldus van den Hoek – Max Euwe, The Hague 1942
22...¦xb2! 23.¦xb2 £e5 A double threat. 24.¦fb1 £xh2† 25.¢f1 ¥f4!–+  The queen is 
trapped.


480. Max Euwe – George Thomas, Zaandam 1946
38.¥g6†! ¢e6 39.¥f7†! ¢d6 40.£d8†! Black resigned due to 40...¢c6 41.¥e8†  and he has 
to part with his queen.


481. Max Euwe – Daniel Yanofsky, Groningen 1946
28.¥c5! 28.¥b8? allows 28...¢e6 since 29.a6 ¥xe4 30.a7 c5= defends. 28...¥d3 The a-pawn 
is unstoppable after 28...dxc5 29.a6+–. 29.¥xd6²  Black should be able to draw this. 28.¥c5 
is nevertheless the best move since it is the only one that has any chance of winning, and in the 
game it gave Euwe the full point (1–0, 46 moves).


482. Henry Grob – Max Euwe, Zurich (2) 1947
21...¥xf2†! 21...£xe5 22.¤xe5 and White is clearly better, no matter how Black takes on f2. He 
has no time for 22...¥xf2† 23.¢h2 ¥xe1? due to 24.¤xf7†+–. 22.¢f1 22.¢xf2 £xe5–+  wins 
the queen. 22...¥xe1 23.£xf4 ¦xf4–+ 


483. Max Euwe – Paul Keres, The Hague/Moscow (1) 1948
38...¦xc1! 39.h3 39.¦xc1? ¤f3†–+  wins the queen, so the only move was 39.£f2µ , to defend 
the f3-square. The queenside pawns give some hope of survival, even though Black is a piece up. 
39...¤f3†–+  For some reason, Keres didn’t execute the fork but he was still winning after 39...£g3.


484. Esteban Canal – Max Euwe, Dubrovnik (ol) 1950
11.¥xd4! exd4 12.£a4†! b5 12...¢e7 13.£xd4± 13.¥xb5†! axb5 14.£xb5† £d7± It’s 
possible to be exact here, but you don’t have to see the move in advance. 15.¤xd5! The game 
continued 15.£xd5?! £xd5 16.¤xd5 when 16...¦a5± wins back one of the pawns. 15.£xd7†?! is 
also dubious, since it helps Black to develop the h8-rook one move faster. After 15.¤xd5! (which, 
we repeat, you don’t need to see in advance to earn full points) White manoeuvres the knight to 
b5 – a better square. He can, for instance, take on d4 after: 15...£xb5 16.¤c7† ¢d7 17.¤xb5 
¦e8† 18.¢d2 ¦e5 19.¤xd4+–


485. Max Euwe – Yuri Averbakh, Zurich 1953
36...¤xa3! 36...¤c7µ 37.¥xa3 ¤b5 38.¥c1 ¤xc3–+  White has to sacrifice the bishop for 
the a-pawn, and the knight for the b-pawn. 38...a3? 39.¢d2=


486. Max Euwe – Daniel Yanofsky, Munich (ol) 1958
25.¦xe6! fxe6 26.£xg6†  White’s attack is so clearly winning that no more variations are 
needed. Euwe won after: 26...¢f8 27.¦d3+– 1–0


487. Enrico Paoli – Max Euwe, Chaumont Neuchatel 1958
17.¥xg6†! hxg6 18.£xg6† ¢d8 18...¢f8 19.£f7 mate  19.£xg7 Instead of being a pawn 
down, White is a pawn up. The opposite-coloured bishops give Black full compensation, but 
that’s better than the alternative – to have a position that is clearly worse. 19...£h5 20.¥f4© 


488. Mikhail Botvinnik – Moisey Kagan, Leningrad 1926
27.¤xe4! ¦xc2 28.£xc2+– White has won a pawn, since 28...fxe4 is met by 29.£xc8† ¦xc8? 
30.¦xc8†  with back-rank mate.


489. Ilya Rabinovich – Mikhail Botvinnik, Moscow 1927
21...¦xf4! Not as good is 21...exf3 22.£xg6 hxg6 23.¦c1 fxe2† 24.¤xe2 when the bishop pair 
gives a clear advantage. 22.gxf4 £g3–+  Black’s position is simply winning, with 23...¥c5, 
 
23...e3, 23...¦f8 and 23...¥h3 all being strong moves. 23.¤xe4 23.fxe4 and among others 
23...¥h3† 24.¦xh3 £xh3† 25.¢f2 ¥xc3–+. 23...dxe4 Easy is 23...¥h3† 24.¦xh3 £xh3† 
25.¢g1 dxe4–+ with an extra piece. 24.¦xd7 ¥c5!–+ Black checkmates or wins the rook on h1 
(0–1, 42 moves). But not 24...e3?? 25.¦xg7†!+–.


490. Nil Panchenko – Mikhail Botvinnik, Leningrad 1927
19...¤xd5! The Lars Christofersson trap, as we say in the north part of Lund. The knight is saved 
with a lifeline after: 20.¥xe7 ¤xe7µ  (½–½, 48 moves)
 
491. Mikhail Botvinnik – Nikolay Pavlov-Pianov, Moscow 1927
28.¦xd7! ¥xd7 28...£xd7 29.£xf8 mate  29.e6! White wins a piece, due to: 29...¥xe6 
30.¦xe6 £xe6 31.£xf8 mate 


492. Mikhail Botvinnik – V. Breitman, Leningrad 1931
23.¤f5! 1–0 A few other moves also promise White good winning chances. The main point of 
the text move is that 23...gxf5 24.£g5+–  forces Black to give up the unprotected queen to 
avoid mate.


493. Mikhail Botvinnik – Vladimir Alatortsev, Moscow 1931
White obviously has a much better position, but he also has the opportunity to immediately 
capitalize on Black’s set-up. 24.¦xg4! £xg4 25.¥h3 £f3 25...£h4 26.¥e6†+– 26.¦f1 The 
queen is trapped. 26...¤xg3 27.¦xf3 ¦xf3 Black gained two rooks in return, but the variation 
is not over yet. 28.¤xg3 ¦xg3 29.¥e6†  30.£f2† or 30.£h2† picks up the rook (or leads to 
mate).


494. Mikhail Botvinnik – Vladimir Alatortsev, Leningrad 1932
21.e4! White breaks through, as Black cannot allow the check on f7. 21...¤xe5 a) 21...dxe4 
22.£f7† ¢h8 (22...¢h6 23.¥xf5+– followed by a check on g4 or a rook lift to h3.) 23.¤xg6† 
(23.¤xb6 ¤xb6 24.£xb7+–) 23...hxg6 24.£xg6+– Black’s extra piece, which is hiding on the 
queenside, can’t protect the king. A direct threat is 25.¥xf5 followed by 26.¦c3. b) 21...fxe4 
22.¤xd7 (or 22.¥xd7 ¤xd7 23.¤xd7 £xd7 24.¤xb6+–) 22...¤xd7 23.¥xd7 £xd7 24.¤xb6  
and 25.¤xa8+– 22.dxe5 fxe4 23.¤xb6 ¦a7+–  More moves are not needed, but one way to 
win is 24.£e3 planning a discovered attack against the a7-rook. White chose another good move 
with 24.e6 (1–0, 31 moves).


495. Mikhail Botvinnik – Mikhail Yudovich, Leningrad 1933
22.¤xg6! There is a second solution: 22.¤g5†! hxg5 23.¤xg6 £e8 24.¤xf8†+– 22...¢xg6 
23.¥h5†!! 1–0 Black resigned due to 23...¢xh5 24.¤g3†!  ¢h4 25.£e4† ¦f4 26.£xf4 mate.


496. Victor Goglidze – Mikhail Botvinnik, Moscow 1935
24...¥xa3! 24...£xe2 25.¥xf8 ¢xf8 26.£xb6= 25.¦xa3 £xe2 26.£xb6 ¦ab8! 27.£d6 £xf1†! 
The point of the exchange on a3 was to force White’s a-rook to leave the first rank. 28.¢xf1 
¦b1† Black resigned due to 29.¢e2 ¦c2 mate .


497. Mikhail Botvinnik – Vitaly Chekhover, Moscow 1935
29.¥e6† ¤xe6 30.£xe6† ¢h8 31.£h3† White can also start with 31.¦xf6. 31...¢g8 32.¦xf6! 
¥xf6 33.£h7† Or immediately 33.¦e1!+–. 33...¢f8 34.¦e1!+–  Black must give up almost 
everything to avoid mate (1–0, 43 moves).


498. Viacheslav Ragozin – Mikhail Botvinnik, Moscow 1938
25...¦xf2! 26.¦xf2 26.¢xf2 £d2†! 27.¥e2 and Black wins after 27...¥d4† or 27...f5 28.£f4 
¥d4† . 26...£xc1†–+  Black has won a pawn and more will come (0–1, 31 moves).


499. Alexander Kotov – Mikhail Botvinnik, Leningrad 1939
37...£xg2†! 38.£xg2 ¦xe2–+  Black has won an exchange and a pawn.


500. Vladimir Makogonov – Mikhail Botvinnik, Moscow 1940
40.¦xf8†! £xf8 40...¢xf8 41.£b8† £e8 42.£xe8 mate  41.£d5† ¢h8 41...£f7 42.¦e8 
mate  42.£xc4+–  Black resigned a move later.


501. Andor Lilienthal – Mikhail Botvinnik, Leningrad/Moscow 1941
39...¦g2! 40.£e4 40.£xg2 £h5 mate  is clear and 40.£f1 can be met with 40...¦b2–+  
or 40...¦a2–+. White has problems with his king and Black wins the pawn on b3, or plays 
for more. 40...¦xh2† 40...£xb3–+ also wins a second pawn (and full points). 41.¢xh2 £h5† 
42.¢g2 £xd1–+  (0–1, 55 moves)


502. Mikhail Botvinnik – Viacheslav Ragozin, Moscow 1945
Black cannot keep his extra piece, but he can lose it in a clever way. 17...¤xd4†! 18.exd4 ¦c2†! 
Ragozin played 18...£xd4? 19.¦xc8 £xf4 20.¦hc1± (1–0, 40 moves). 19.¥d2 19.¦xc2 £xc2† 
20.¥d2 £xb2–+  19...¦xb2! 19...¦xd2†?! 20.¢xd2 £xd4† wins another pawn for the exchange 
and secures a small advantage as well after 21.¢c2! £xf2† 22.¢b1. 20.¥xa4 ¦xb7µ  Black is 
a pawn up and the bishop pair is more than compensated for by the difference in pawn islands.


503. Arnold Denker – Mikhail Botvinnik, Radio Match 1945
22...¦xh2†! 23.¢xh2 ¦h8†–+  White loses the queen (0–1, 25 moves).


504. Mikhail Botvinnik – Alexander Kotov, Groningen 1946
23...£xg3†! 24.¢xg3 ¤e4†–+  A fork and a pin (0–1, 45 moves).


505. Mikhail Botvinnik – Paul Keres, Moscow 1952
30.¤f5! ¦ee8 30...gxf5 31.¦g3† ¤g7 32.£f6  is followed by 33.£xg7 mate. The game saw 
30...¦fe8+– (1–0, 37 moves). 31.¤h6† ¢h8 31...¢g7 32.£f6† ¢xh6 33.¦h3 mate  32.£f6†  
¤g7 33.¤xf7†+– Or anything else.


506. Mikhail Botvinnik – Vassily Smyslov, Moscow (10) 1954
24...¤xe5!µ Black wins a pawn, since 25.fxe5? £xe4†–+  picks up the rook on h1. Botvinnik 
postponed resignation with 25.£e3 (0–1, 37 moves).


507. Mikhail Botvinnik – Vassily Smyslov, Moscow (12) 1954
31.f7†! ¦xf7 32.£d8† ¢h7 32...¦f8 33.¥xd5†+–  33.¥xd5! Forking three pieces! 33...¤f2† 
34.¢g2 £f6 Saving the rook, but not the knight. 35.£xf6 ¦xf6 36.¢xf2 ¦xf5† 37.¥f3!+–  
¦f4 38.¦g4 1–0


508. Paul Keres – Mikhail Botvinnik, Moscow 1955
9.£a4†! 9.¥xd5 ¤xb3 10.¥xb3 ¥xg2= 9...£d7 9...b5 10.¥xd5  bxa4 11.¥xf3+– and White 
has three threats: 12.¥xa8, 12.dxe5 and 12.b4. 10.¥xf7†! ¢d8 10...¢xf7 11.£xd7†+–  
11.£xd7†! ¢xd7 12.¤xf3+–  White is a pawn up and has the bishop pair and safer king to 
boot (1–0, 27 moves).


509. Mikhail Botvinnik – Nikola Padevsky, Moscow (ol) 1956
23.¤xf6! ¢f7 23...¦xd1 24.¤d5†!+–  wins the queen and 23...¦d4 is not a safe stopper: 
24.e3+– (or 24.¤g4+–); 23...£xf6 24.£xf6† ¢xf6 25.¦xd8+–  24.¦xd8 £xd8 25.¤xh7+–  
White has won two pawns (1–0, 32 moves).


510. Vassily Smyslov – Mikhail Botvinnik Moscow (4) 1957
35...¦xd5! 35...£g1† 36.¦d1 £e3! 37.£xe3† ¥xe3 38.¦e1! ¦xd5 39.¦xe3–+ is the slow way 
to (probably) win. 36.¦xd5 £g1† 37.¢c2 37.£d1 £xd1† 38.¦xd1 ¦xd1†–+  37...¦c8† 
38.¢d3 £b1†! 39.¢d4 £xb2†–+  White will soon have to give up his queen to avoid mate 
(0–1, 41 moves).


511. Mikhail Tal – Mikhail Botvinnik, Moscow (17) 1960
40.¦xa6†! bxa6 41.£b6† ¢a8 42.£xa6† ¦a7 43.£xc8 mate 


512. Anatoly Karpov – Mikhail Botvinnik, Moscow (simul) 1964
32...¤xd4! 33.£xd4? Karpov played the better 33.¦d2–+ and managed to draw after 42 moves. 
33...¥c5–+ 


513. Yoel Aloni – Mikhail Botvinnik, Tel Aviv (ol) 1964
33...£h3†! 34.¢g1 d2! 35.¤xg6† 35.£xd2 ¦f1 mate  35...hxg6 36.£h4† ¢g8! 36...£xh4? 
37.¦xh4† ¢g8 38.¦d5 ¥c3³ 0–1 White resigned, since 37.£xh3 d1=£†  wins the queen or 
mates.


514. Mikhail Botvinnik – Lajos Portisch, Monte Carlo 1968
18.¦xf7! ¢xf7 The game continued: 18...h6 (1–0, 26 moves) 19.£c4†  19.¤g5† is also 
winning, but it is more difficult since White has to make a non-checking move after 19...¢e7: 
 
a) 20.¥xc6+–; b) 20.£h4+– or c) 20.£b3+–. 19...¢g6 The alternatives lose material on the spot. 
20.£g4† Several other moves win as well. 20...¢f7 21.¤g5†+– Black is mated in four moves if 
he doesn’t give up his queen.


515. Vassily Smyslov – Viacheslav Ragozin, Leningrad/Moscow 1939
31...¤xf4!–+ The knight takes a pawn and threatens to continue to d3, where it cannot be taken 
due to the mate on g2. 32.£xf4? 32.bxc4 ¤d3! wins for Black, as does the game move 32.¢g3 
(0–1, 35 moves). 32...£h1† 33.¢g3 £g1† 34.¢h4 g5†–+ 


516. Vassily Smyslov – Kirilov, Moscow 1940
16.¦xa6! ¦xa6 Kirilov played 16...¦c8+– (1–0, 23 moves). 17.¤xb5 In a way it is a double 
threat with 18.¤c7, since it is both mate and a (triple) fork. 17...cxb5 18.£c8 mate 


517. Georgy Lisitsin – Vassily Smyslov, Moscow 1944
23...¦xc4! 24.£xc4 ¤e3! A double threat: mate and the queen. 25.£f1 25.fxe3 ¥xe3† 26.¢f1 
£f3† 27.¢e1 £f2 mate  25...¤xf1–+ (0–1, 40 moves)


518. Grigory Ravinsky – Vassily Smyslov, Moscow 1944
30...¥xf2†! 30...¤xe4? 31.¦xe4 ¥xf2† 32.¢g2 ¦c3 (32...¥e1 33.¦xe1µ) is a creative try to 
promote the pawn, but White can put the queen on d1 or take the bait: 33.£xc3 d1=£ 34.¦g4 
g6 35.¦c4 with counterplay. 31.¦xf2 Ravinsky played 31.¢g2–+ (0–1, 41 moves) when White 
at least loses the e4-pawn if he takes the pawn on d2. 31...¤xe4  0–1 Black will pick up 
material/promote and then mate. 31...¦d8 is also winning, as is 31...¦c3 32.£xc3 d1=£–+. 
(But not 32...£xf2†? 33.¢xf2 d1=¤† 34.¢e1 ¤xc3=.)


519. Vassily Smyslov – Vladimir Alatortsev, Moscow 1945
39.c6! bxc6 40.b6! ¥c8 41.a6  Black has to give up the bishop and the knight. 41...¤d8+– 
Trying to sacrifice only the bishop for both pawns. That would still be winning for White, but 
even stronger is a move such as 42.¥f1! when White is ready to meet 42...c5 with 43.¥g2†. Black 
basically has no moves.


520. Isaak Boleslavsky – Vassily Smyslov, Groningen 1946
25...¥xc1! 26.¦xc1 White did not have to take immediately. The only threatening move was 
26.¤g5 when 26...£d4! is best. 27.¤xe6 (27.¦xc1 £a7–+) 27...£d7  (or 27...¤e8–+ with 
a threat against f2) 28.£xd7 ¤xd7 29.¤xf8 ¢xf8 30.¦xc1 ¦xb7–+ The two connected passed 
pawns, supported by the rook and knight, should decide. 26...¦xb7!–+  Black enjoys the extra 
exchange without the compensating passed pawn on b7 (0–1, 34 moves).


521. Vassily Smyslov – Cenek Kottnauer, Groningen 1946
18.¤c5! dxc5 18...¦c7 19.¤xd7! ¦xd7 20.¦a8+–  19.¥f4! The queen has no squares to keep 
the rook on b7 defended. Worse is 19.¦a8? £xa8 20.¦xd7 ¦xd7! 21.£xa8† ¢e7! and White 
can’t defend both the king and the bishop (but he can give up the bishop and make a draw by 
perpetual). 19...£xf4 Instead Black tried: 19...¥d6 20.¥xd6 ¦b6 21.£xd7†! 1–0 20.£xb7+– 


522. Vassily Smyslov – Kazimierz Plater, Moscow 1947
18.¤f5!+– White wins the pawn on d6 (1–0, 23 moves), or: 18...gxf5 19.£g5† ¥g7 20.£xg7 
mate 


523. Vassily Smyslov – Genrikh Kasparian, Leningrad 1947
Black has a double threat against the queen and the rook on a8. 28.¦xe6†! ¢xe6 28...fxe6 
29.£xg7 mate  29.£g4†+–  White can play for mate, but he can also take on h8 now when 
the queen has moved away from the threat (1–0, 39 moves).


524. Gedeon Barcza – Vassily Smyslov, Budapest 1949
18...¤e3! 19.fxe3 The game continued: 19.¦c1 ¤xf1–+ (0–1, 40 moves) 19...¥xe3†–+ 


525. Grigory Levenfish – Vassily Smyslov, Moscow 1949
32.¦h8†! ¢f7 32...¢xh8 33.£h6† ¢g8 34.£g7 mate  33.¤g5† There is no way to force 
resignation after 33.¦xa8?! £xa8 34.¤g5† ¢f8!+–. 33...¢g7 34.¦xa8 1–0 Black resigned, as 
34...£xa8 35.£e7†+–  wins the knight.


526. Semen Furman – Vassily Smyslov, Moscow 1949
30.¤xg6†! £xg6 30...hxg6 31.¦h3 mate  31.¦xc4†  £g7 32.£xg7† ¢xg7 White wins a 
second pawn with 33.¦c7†+– (1–0, 53 moves) or 33.¦a4+–.


527. Enrico Paoli – Vassily Smyslov, Venice 1950
32...¦xc2! 33.£xc2 33.¦xe5 defends against the check on f3, but the problem is the undefended 
rook on a1: 33...£xe5 34.£xc2 £xa1–+  33...¤f3† 34.¢f2 34.¢h1 £g3  and 35...£h2/£g1 
mate. 34...£g3†! 35.¢e2 ¤fd4† Or 35...¤ed4+–. 36.¢d1 ¤xc2–+ 


528. Isaak Boleslavsky – Vassily Smyslov, Moscow 1950
16.¤xb5! £xb5 Black played: 16...c6+– (1–0, 83 moves) 17.¥a4±  There would follow 
18.¥xd7.
 
529. Vassily Smyslov – Efim Geller, Moscow 1951
31.¦xf6! ¢xf6 31...£e7–+ was played in the game (1–0, 48 moves). 32.£h6† ¢f7 33.£xh7† 
¢f6 34.£xb7+– 


530. Gideon Stahlberg – Vassily Smyslov, Stockholm 1954
36...¤xg3! 37.hxg3 37.¦g4 does not keep the material balance, for example: 37...¤e4 38.¦xg5† 
¤xg5 39.¤c4 ¦e4 40.¤d6 ¦xa4³ 37...¦xg3† 38.¢f1 ¦exe3 39.¦xe3 ¦xe3 40.¦xa7  White 
should draw, but Black is pressing. That is quite a difference from the starting position, where 
White was a pawn up. 40...¢f5³ (0–1, 64 moves)


531. Vassily Smyslov – Wolfgang Unzicker, Hastings 1954
25.¥h3! £xh3 26.¥xd6+–  White chooses between the c7- and e5-pawns.


532. Vassily Smyslov – Laszlo Szabo, Hastings 1954
35.c6! Clearing c5 for the knight. 35...exf4† 36.¢xf4 bxc6 The only way to stop 37.c7. 37.¤c5† 
¢d6 38.¤xb3+–  (1–0, 43 moves)


533. Paul Keres – Vassily Smyslov, Moscow 1955
31...¦h1†! Magnet sacrifice. 32.¢xh1 Keres played 32.¢g3. Without the rook hanging on 
c1, Black can play 32...g6–+ with an extra rook, or go for a winning attack with 32...¦d3†. 
32...£d1†! 33.¢h2 £xg4 34.hxg4 gxh6–+ 


534. Vassily Smyslov – Miguel Najdorf, Moscow 1956
27.¤xh7!± White won a pawn, since 27...¤xh7? isn’t possible: 28.£xe7 ¦xe7 29.¦xc8†+–  
Najdorf fought on with 27...¢g7 and made a draw.


535. Mikhail Tal – Vassily Smyslov, Bled/Zagreb/Belgrade 1959
19.£xf7! 19.¤xf7†? ¢g8 20.¤h6† gxh6 21.£xh6= and White holds the balance after some 
accuracy. The game move highlights the awkward placement of the black bishops. 19...£a1† 
19...¦xf7 20.¦xd8† ¦f8 21.¦xf8† mate  20.¢d2 ¦xf7 20...£xd1† 21.¦xd1 (or 21.¢xd1 ¦xf7 
22.¤xf7† ¢g8 23.¤xd8+–) 21...¦xf7 22.¤xf7† ¢g8 23.¤xd8+–  21.¤xf7† ¢g8 22.¦xa1+–  
(1–0, 26 moves)


536. Robert Fischer – Vassily Smyslov, Bled/Zagreb/Belgrade 1959
Black has a large material advantage, but is under attack. 32...£f5! 32...¢f8 33.¦xg5 £d3! 
34.¦d1² 33.¢g1 33.£d1 £xf1† 34.£xf1 ¦cb5  regains the queen with a winning material 
advantage and 33.£e2 can be met in the same way, or with 33...¦b2 34.£e1 £g6 35.h4 e3–+. 
 
33...£g6!–+  Black managed to defend his king, retaining a winning material advantage. 
34.£e2 ¦c6 Even better is: 34...¦cb5! 35.h4 ¦b2 36.£e1 (36.£d1 e3–+) 36...e3 37.hxg5 e2–+ 
35.h4 ¦xf6 Still, Black had enough pawns to win (48 moves).


537. Nikolac Bakulin – Vassily Smyslov, Moscow 1961
39...£xb2! 40.¥xb2 ¦d2†–+  Black wins back the queen, and then both bishops. In the game, 
40.¦e2–+ limited the loss to a second pawn, but even that was too much (0–1, 41 moves). 


538. Vassily Smyslov – Ratmir Kholmov, Baku 1961
33.¦xf6†! ¢xf6 33...gxf6 shows why the knight had to go: 34.¥d5†! ¢f8 35.¤e6† with 
beautiful coordination of the white pieces. 35...¢f7 (35...¢e7 going for the d5-bishop does not 
help because of the bishop on e8: 36.¤d4† ¢d6 37.¤xc2 ¢xd5 38.¦xe8+– ) 36.¤d4†! ¢f8 
37.¤xc2+–  34.¦xe8±  By keeping the rooks on the board, White can play for an attack 
 
(1–0, 43 moves).


539. Vassily Smyslov – Hector Rossetto, Mar del Plata 1962
37.e4! 37.exd4 ¤xd4= is a double threat. 37...¥xe4 38.¤xe4 ¦xe4+–  By forcing Black’s rook 
to an unpleasant square, while keeping the king away from checks, White has made the c-pawn a 
winner. Most moves win, among them Smyslov’s: 39.¦b1 ¦e3 40.¦b8† ¢g7 41.¥c4 1–0


540. Georgi Tringov – Vassily Smyslov, Havana 1965
37...¦xg3! 38.¢xg3 38.£xa5 £h4  0–1 was the game, with mate. 38...£c3† 39.¢f2 
 
£xd2†–+  Black either picks up the f4-pawn with check or forces mate.


541. Vassily Smyslov – Eleazar Jimenez Zerquera, Havana 1965
37...£e3! 38.¢e1! The only defence against mate. 38.¦xe3 ¦xd1† 39.¢g2 ¦g1 mate  
38...£g1†! 39.¢d2 ¦xd3†! 40.exd3 40.£xd3 £xd1†! 41.¢xd1 ¤f2†–+  40...£xh2† 
41.¢c3 £xg3–+ It’s too many pawns (0–1, 59 moves).


542. Efim Geller – Vassily Smyslov, Moscow 1965
32.¥f8! White could maybe have postponed the sacrifice for one move, although that would 
be somewhat weaker – Black had no sufficient defence. 32...¢xf8 32...£xf8 33.£h7 mate  
(or 33.£h8 mate) 33.£h8† ¥g8 34.¦h7!+–  Taking the queen with the rook is stronger, 
since there is more to come with e5-e6 and £f6†. Geller played 34.¤h7†?! ¢f7 35.e6† £xe6 
36.¤g5† ¢e7 37.¤xe6 ¥xe6 38.£g7† ¢d6+– when White is probably winning, but not easily 
 
(1–0, 60 moves).


543. Vassily Smyslov – Antonio Magrin, Lugano (ol) 1968
34.¤f7†! ¦xf7 35.¦g5+–  The only defence against 36.¦xh5 mate is to give back the piece, 
when White still has a winning attack (1–0, 41 moves).


544. Donald Byrne – Vassily Smyslov, Lugano (ol) 1968
24...¤xg3! 25.fxg3 £xg3† 26.¢g1 £h2†  Black has a winning attack. 27.¢f2 ¥g3† There 
are other moves as well. 28.¢e3 ¥xe1 0–1 It will soon be mate.


545. Mikhail Tal – Vassily Smyslov, Herceg Novi (blitz) 1970
33...¤xh3†! 34.gxh3 ¦xh3 It is not possible to save the knight on g4. 35.£d4 ¦d3–+ 
 
(0–1, 39 moves) Or 35...h5–+.


546. Leonid Stein – Vassily Smyslov, Moscow 1972
28.¦h8! The g2-bishop is unpinned and White wins material. Stein executed the same motif 
with: 28.£xc6 ¦xc6 29.¦h8!+– (1–0, 35 moves) 28...£xb7 29.¦xg8† ¢e7 30.¥xb7+– 


547. Vassily Smyslov – Roman Dzindzichashvili, Moscow 1972
17.¤xe6! fxe6 18.£g4 A double threat against g7 and e6. 18...¤f6 18...¤de5 19.£xe6† ¢h8 
20.¤xb6 is similar to the game and 18...¤ce5? 19.£xe6† ¢f8 20.f4+–  wins back the piece. 
19.£xe6† ¢h8 20.¤xb6±  White gets more than enough for the knights: a rook and three 
pawns (1–0, 26 moves).


548. Vassily Smyslov – Walter Browne, Hastings 1972
16.¤xb5! ¦xb5 Browne fought on with 16...¥a6± (0–1, 33 moves). 17.¦xc8 £xc8 18.¤xe7† 
¢h8 19.¤xc8+– 


549. Gerardo Lebredo Zarragoitia – Vassily Smyslov, Cienfuegos 1973
36...£f1†! 37.¢g3 h4†! 38.¢g4 38.¢xh4 £xf4† 39.g4  Black wins the bishop in several 
ways, for instance 39...£g5†–+. 38...£xg2†  The king cannot go to the fifth rank due to the 
queen check on d5 and after 39.¢xh4 there are again several ways to win. Easiest is: 39...g5† 
40.¢h5 gxf4–+


550. Vassily Smyslov – Boris Spassky, Moscow 1973
27...h6! 27...¥d8? 28.¥e3³ does not win material. 28.¥h4 ¥d8–+  Smyslov gave up a second 
exchange and continued for just a few moves (0–1, 33 moves).


551. Vassily Smyslov – Istvan Bilek, Venice 1974
18.¥xg7! A magnet exchange followed by a clearance sacrifice. 18...¢xg7 19.d5! White threatens 
20.dxc6 as well as 20.£d4† ¢g8 21.£xg4. 19...¢g8 20.dxc6±  (1–0, 30 moves)


552. Garry Kasparov – Vassily Smyslov, Leningrad 1975
26...¥xf6! 26...¥xg2? does not work immediately: 27.h4! and the queen cannot keep a connection 
to both f4 and g2: 27...£h6 (27...£g6 28.£xg2+–) 28.¢xg2+– 27.¦xf6 ¥xg2! Black wins 
an important pawn. 28.h4 The game continued: 28.¢h2? ¦e3–+ (28...¥xh3 is also winning) 
Instead, White should settle for 28.¦f5 ¦xf5 29.£xf5 £xf5 30.¤xf5 ¥xh3µ. 28...£g4–+  
There is a threat against d1. Also winning is 28...£h5.


553. Vassily Smyslov – Lothar Vogt, Leningrad 1977
White efficiently removes the black pawns on d5, e6 and f7: 24.gxf7†! ¢xf7 25.¤xe6! ¦xe6 
26.¥xd5  White wins the whole rook on e6 with a huge material surplus (1–0, 40 moves).


554. Vassily Smyslov – Jingxuan Qi, Buenos Aires 1978
Black is a rook up, but is about to lose it. However, there is a way to keep the bishop. 
 
22...f4! 23.£xf4 23.gxf4?! ¦g6†!–+  23...£c7 24.¤xc6 £xc6µ  The queen cannot take 
on e7 anymore. White later managed to outplay his much lower-rated opponent though 
 
(1–0, 74 moves).


555. Vassily Smyslov – Wlodzimierz Schmidt, Moscow 1980
35.£xf6†! £xf6 36.¦d7† ¢h6 37.¦xf6  A pawn and an ongoing attack should be enough to 
win (1–0, 38 moves).


556. Vassily Smyslov – Robert Hübner, Velden 1983
32.¥xh7! ¦xh7 32...¥xh7 33.¤g6†+–  winning the rook on f8. 33.¤g6† White has a decisive 
attack. 33...¢g7 34.£d7†! 34.£g4! also wins but 34.¦xf8 ¦xh3 35.¦xa8 is less clear, even 
though it should be winning eventually. 34...¦f7 35.¦xf7† ¥xf7 36.¤xe5+–  (1–0, 48 moves)


557. Vassily Smyslov – Gennadi Sosonko, Tilburg 1984
30.¦xf8†! ¢xf8 31.£c5† Black resigned, as White picks up the rook on d3 after: 31...¢g8 
32.£c8† ¢h7 33.£f5† ¢g8 34.£xd3+– 


558. Kevin Spraggett – Vassily Smyslov, Montpellier 1985
14...¥xh3! 0–1 White resigned (prematurely). The point is: 15.gxh3 ¥xd4 16.¥xd4 ¤f3† 
17.¢g2 ¤xd4µ  White is a pawn down and is weak on the dark squares. But it would not hurt 
to play on with, for instance, 15.¥e2µ.


559. Vassily Smyslov – Helgi Olafsson, Copenhagen 1985
23.¤xb7! ¥xc2 23...¢xb7 24.¦c7† ¢b6 25.¦xe7±  24.¤xd6 The knight is trapped after 
24.¤xd8? ¥g6–+. 24...¥xb3 25.¤f7! ¦f8 26.axb3 ¦xf7 27.¦c5!±  White wins a pawn 
 
(1–0, 53 moves). 27.¦d1 is also good enough. 


560. Petar Popovic – Vassily Smyslov, Ljubljana 1985
28.¦xe7! ¦xe7 29.£xf6+–  Black is lost on the dark squares and cannot close the diagonal. 
 
The game finished: 29...¦e5 29...¦ce8 30.£h8† ¢f7 31.£g7 mate 30.£xd6 1–0


561. Ilya Smirin – Vassily Smyslov, Moscow 1988
22.¤xf7! ¦xf7 22...¢xf7 could be met with, among others, 23.¤g5† ¢g8 24.¤xe6 and White 
wins back the piece (at least) and keeps the pawns. 23.¥xe6+–  Black is unable to deal with 
24.¤g5 and 24.¤e5 (1–0, 28 moves).


562. Vassily Smyslov – Jan Timman, Moscow (blitz) 1993
24.¦xf6! exf6 25.£xh7† ¢f8 Timman may have thought that the king was escaping. 26.¦e1! 
¥e6 27.¦xe6!  1–0 It is mate on f7.


563. Vassily Smyslov – Lembit Oll, Rostov on Don 1993
29.g4†! ¢xe4 29...¢xg4 30.fxg5†+– 30.¤f2† ¢xf4 31.¦g1! The threat is 32.¥d2 mate. 
 
31...e4 32.¤h3 mate 


564. Susan Polgar – Vassily Smyslov, Vienna 1993
Loose pieces, even queens, are in danger of dropping off. 40.¦c8† ¢h7 41.¦h8†! ¢xh8 
42.¤g6† ¢h7 43.¤xh4+–  (1–0, 63 moves)


565. Vassily Smyslov – Johan Ingbrandt, Stockholm 1996
21.¤xe5! ¥xe5 22.£h5+–  The pin along the fifth rank wins back the piece, with numerous 
threats against the remaining bishop, the queen, the king and the weak pawns – something will 
drop off. But instead 22.£d5?! ¦d8 23.£xe5 £xe5 24.¦xe5 ¥g6 is not so much better for White.


566. Ketevan Arakhamia-Grant – Vassily Smyslov, London 1996
29.¤f6†! 29.¦xg7†? ¢xg7 30.¦g1† ¥g6 and White’s best is a repetition with: 31.£c7† £f7 
32.£c3† ¢h7 33.¤f6† ¢h8 34.¤h5† ¢h7 35.¤f6† 29...¢f7 29...¢f8 30.£c5†!  transposes, 
as 30...¦e7+– moves into a deadly pin. And 29...¢h8 is met by: 30.¦d8† ¦xd8 31.£xd8† ¦e8 
32.£xe8 mate  30.£c7†! ¦e7 30...¢xf6 and Black is mated after 31.£xg7†  or 31.¦d6†. 
31.¦xg7†! ¢xg7 32.£xe7†  White’s position is generally winning, but there is also a mating 
attack on the way. Black resigned after: 32...¢h8 33.¦g1 1–0 33.¦d7 is also good enough. 


567. Mikhail Tal – A. Leonov, Vilnius 1949
22.¤f6†! 22.¦f6!? gxf6? 23.¤xh6†+– and 22.£h4 both retain a huge advantage. 22...¤xf6 
After 22...gxf6, White can transpose or use one of the extra options: 23.¥xh7† and 23.¦g4† are 
both winning. 23.exf6 ¤xf6 23...¦c7 24.fxg7 was the game, and Black resigned on the next 
move. 24.¦xf6 £g7 25.¦xh6 f5 26.£h4+–  White is a pawn up and can manoeuvre the other 
rook into the attack.


568. Marks Pasman – Mikhail Tal, Riga 1952
17...¤g3†! 18.¢g2 18.¤xg3 fxg3 (or 18...¦xh2† 19.¢xh2 fxg3†–+, winning the queen) 19.£xg5 
¦xh2 mate  18...£h4! There are threats against h3 and h2. Not 18...¥xg4? 19.¥xg3! and White 
holds on. 19.¥xg3 fxg3 20.hxg3 20.¤xg3 £xh2† 21.¢f1 £xd2–+  20...£h2† 21.¢f1 ¦f6!–+  
The only way to win after 17...¤g3†. Black threatens 22...¦xf3† and 22...¥xg4 (0–1, 35 moves).


569. Mikhail Tal – Artur Darznieks, Riga 1953
16.¤xb5! £a5 White loses a piece on the queenside, but is compensated on f7 and e8. 
 
16...cxb5? loses straight away: 17.¥xf7† ¢xf7 18.¦xc7+–  17.¤d6 Or 17.¥xf7† ¢xf7 
18.¦xc6+–, or 17.b4+–. 17...£xa3 18.¥xf7† ¢h8 19.¤xe8 ¤xe8 20.¥xe8 ¦xe8 21.¦xc6+– 
White has too many pawns.


570. Mikhail Tal – Vladimir Saigin, Riga 1954
15...c6!µ White has to retreat, since 16.dxc6? £b6–+  is a double threat. Tal managed to draw 
after 16.¥c4µ.


571. A. Ostrauskas – Mikhail Tal, Vilnius 1955
31...¥g2†! 32.¢xg2 ¦f2†! 33.¢xf2 £xh2†  34.¢f3 £xc2–+ (0–1, 39 moves)


572. Abram Khasin – Mikhail Tal, Leningrad 1956
32...¦e1! 32...¤e1? 33.¦xe7 ¤xf3 34.¦xe8† ¦xe8 35.gxf3 ¦e2µ 33.£d5 33.¦xe7 ¦xf1† 
(33...¦8xe7?? 34.£f8 mate) 34.£xf1 ¦xe7–+  and the queen cannot be saved. 33...£xf7 
33...£e6 and 33...¢h8 also win. 34.£xf7† ¢h8 35.¢g1 ¦xf1† 36.£xf1 36.¢xf1 ¦e1 mate  
36...¦e1–+ 


573. Bukhuti Gurgenidze – Mikhail Tal, Moscow 1957
14...¤xf2! 15.¢xf2? White should prefer 15.¤f3 ¥xc3 16.bxc3 ¤xe4³ , although he does not 
have full compensation for the two pawns. 15...£h4† 15...¥d4† is pointless after 16.¢g3 even 
though 16...¥e5† 17.¢f2 £h4† 18.¢f1 ¥d4 transposes to the game. 16.¢f1 ¥d4 17.¤d1 The 
only defence against the mate on f2. 17...£xh3!  17...¥xh3?! 18.¦a3!µ is slower but also gives 
full points. 18.¥f3 £h2–+ White is defenceless against ...f7-f5, ...¥a6 and ...¤xd5, although 
that is not so easy to see (0–1, 27 moves).


574. Anatolij Bannik – Mikhail Tal, Moscow 1957
27...¤xe2†! 28.¦xe2 £xc1† Black has won an exchange, but he needs something against the 
following double threat. 29.¦e1 ¥xc3! 30.¦xc1 ¥d4–+ 


575. Mikhail Tal – Rudolf Teschner, Vienna 1957
23.¤e4!  23.¥g7?! ¦g8 24.¤e4 is worse, since the knight has to check on f6 instead of d6: 
24...£d4 25.¤f6† ¥xf6 26.exf6 ¦xg7 27.fxg7 £xg7 and Black is worse but not lost. 23...dxe4 
Otherwise the knight continues to d6, opening up the e-file with devastating effect. I will give 
one sample line to see some attacking ideas for White: 23...£d4 24.¤d6† ¥xd6 25.exd6 ¤fe6 
26.¦ad1 £a7 27.¦de1 ¢d7 28.¦xe6 fxe6 29.£f6 Winning the rook with a continuing attack. 
24.¦ad1+– 24.¥xf7† is also winning, as well as many other moves. 24.¦ac1 £b6 25.¦cd1 
mating, was the game finish.


576. Mikhail Tal – N.N., Riga (simul) 1958
18.¤xf7! ¢xf7 19.£xe6† ¢f8 20.¥c1!+–  Black has no defence against 21.¦f3† ¥f6 22.¥a3† 
(1–0, 27 moves). 20.¦f3†? is a mistake: 20...¥f6 21.¦xf6† £xf6!–+ But 20.¥f4 gives White a 
winning advantage, as does 20.¥xe7†. But to get full points for the last one you have to see all of 
the following moves: 20...¦xe7 21.¦f3† ¢e8 22.£f7†! The only move. 22...¢d7 23.¦xe7† £xe7 
(23...¤xe7 24.£e6† [or 24.d5+–] 24...¢c7 25.¦f7+– winning the knight) 24.¥xd5+–


577. Mikhail Tal – Dieter Keller, Zurich 1959
29.¦b7†! ¢xb7 30.£d7† ¢b8 31.e8=£† ¦xe8 32.£xe8† ¢b7 33.£d7† ¢b8 34.£xc6+–  
It was all forced.


578. Robert Fischer – Mikhail Tal, Bled 1959
20...g6! Spotting the trouble on the a8-h1 diagonal. 21.fxg6 21.g4 is not a move White wants 
to play. One way to punish it is 21...gxf5 22.gxf5 ¢h8–+. 21...f5!–+  Or 21...hxg6!–+ which 
might be even stronger as White cannot save the knight anyway because of the weakness on g2.


579. Mikhail Tal – Wolfgang Unzicker, Stockholm 1960
24.¥xf7†! ¢xf7 25.£b3† White can also start with 25.¤g5†. 25...¢f8 25...¢g6 and for 
example 26.¤h4† ¢h5 27.£f3† ¢xh4 28.£g3† ¢h5 29.£g5 mate. 26.¤g5  1–0 The threat 
of 27.£f7 mate is decisive.


580. Mikhail Tal – Martin Johansson Sr., Stockholm 1961
Thanks to the weak kingside, White is winning after normal moves, but can decide matters right 
now. 21.¦xe6! fxe6 22.¤xe6† ¢g8 23.¦d3+–  To avoid mate, Black must give up the bishop 
and the queen – without getting anything in return.


581. Mikhail Tal – Eero Book, Stockholm 1961
34.¦xf6!± gxf6? 34...¦e1† 35.¦f1±  is Black’s best, accepting the loss of a pawn 
 
(1–0, 48 moves). 35.¤xf6† ¢f7 36.¤xe4+– White wins a second and a third pawn.


582. Mikhail Tal – Bukhuti Gurgenidze, Baku 1961
17.¥xf7†! ¢f8 Black has two other moves: a) 17...¢xf7 18.£b3† ¢f8 19.£xd3±;  
b) 17...¢h8 18.¥xe8 ¤xe8 (18...¤xb2 can be met with either 19.£b3+– or 19.£b1+–) 19.£b3 
¤xe1 20.¦xe1± 18.¥xe8 ¤xb2 19.£b1! 19.£b3? ¤c4 and White cannot save the e8-bishop 
since 20.¤xc4 bxc4 threatens the queen. 19...¤a4 19...¤c4 20.¤xc4 and the bishop escapes 
after 20...bxc4 21.¥a4+–  or 20...£xc4 21.¦c1 £a4 22.¥c6+– . 20.¦c1+–  The bishop 
escapes to c6 (1–0, 35 moves).


583. Mikhail Tal – Paul Keres, Curacao 1962
20...¤xh3†! 20...£b6? 21.e5! (21.£xf2 £xc6 22.e5!= is also not convincing for Black) 21...¤g4† 
(21...¤d3†? 22.¥e3+–) 22.¢h1 ¤xe5 23.¦xe5! (23.¤xe5 ¥xe5 24.£xa8 ¥b7 25.¥a5!=) 
 
23...dxe5 24.¦f1± and White threatens 25.£e4. There is no good defence as the f6-bishop has 
no square, so Black loses a piece. 21.¢h2 21.gxh3 £b6†–+  is a double attack, as is 21.£xh3 
£b6† 22.£e3 £xc6µ . 21...¥e5† Weaker is 21...£c7 22.e5! ¥xe5† 23.¦xe5 (23.¤xe5 £xc2µ) 
23...dxe5 24.¥a5 e4† 25.¥xc7 exf3 26.¤e7†³ when Black has a lot of pawns, but his rooks are 
not very active. 22.¤xe5 dxe5µ  The bishop on d2 is en prise, and Black keeps the two pawns 
(0–1, 41 moves).


584. Mikhail Tal – Aleksandar Matanovic, Moscow 1963
24.¤xf7! ¦xf7 24...¢xf7 25.¥xg6†+–  wins the queen. 25.¥xg6  £d6 25...£xc1 26.¥xf7† 
¢xf7 27.£h5† wins the queen. 26.¥xf7† ¢xf7 27.¦xc8 ¥xc8 28.£c2+– A double attack 
against the bishop and the h7-square. The attack is decisive (1–0, 30 moves).


585. Mikhail Tal – Robert Wade, Reykjavik 1964
21.¥d7! The rook is trapped. 21...¦e6 21...£xd7 22.¤f6† ¢g7 23.¤xd7+–  22.¥xe6+–  
(1–0, 26 moves)


586. Mikhail Tal – Vladimir Ljavdansky, Kiev 1964
29.e7! 29.¤d5!? almost works: 29...¥xd5 30.£xd5 £d8! and Black defends. White can try 
the same idea as in the main line: 30.e7!? ¥xg2†! 31.£xg2 (31.¢xg2? £b7† 32.¢g1 £xe7–+) 
31...¦e8 with the same type of play. However, with the open white king, Black has perpetual 
checks: 32.£d5† ¢g7 33.¦xh7† ¢xh7 34.£f7† ¢h6 35.£xe8 £f2!= 29...¦e8 30.¤d5! The 
queen cannot defend f6, so Black must take. 30...¥xd5 31.£xd5† ¢g7 32.¦xh7†! The queen 
needs to penetrate to f7. 32...¢xh7 33.£f7† ¢h6 34.£xe8 White creates luft for the king with 
check, and queens. 34...£f2 35.£h8† ¢g5 36.h4†! ¢g4 37.e8=£+–  Black has only a few 
checks since e1 is covered by the new queen (1–0, 41 moves).


587. Mikhail Tal – Svetozar Gligoric, Reykjavik 1964
27.¥xe5! It is also possible to start with 27.¤h6†. 27...¦xe5 27...fxe5 keeps the rook on c8 
defended, but Black loses the d-pawn after 28.exd5  29.d6 and 30.¤h6 wins. 28.¤h6† ¢h8 
29.¤f7†! £xf7 30.£xc8+–  (1–0, 40 moves)


588. Anatoly Bykhovsky – Mikhail Tal, Kislovodsk 1964
37...¦xf3! 38.¦c7 A double attack, but the pieces can defend each other. 38.¢xf3 loses to: 
38...¤e5† 39.¢f4 ¤xc6–+  38...¦d3!–+  Not the other way around: 38...¤e5?? 39.¦xe7+–


589. Mikhail Tal – Georgi Tringov, Amsterdam 1964
15.¥xf7†! 15.¦xb7?! is the start of a long forced line: 15...£xc4 16.¦xd7 ¥xd7 17.£xd7† ¢f8 
18.£d6†! ¢e8 19.¥xe5 ¥xe5 20.£xe5† ¢f8 21.£xh8 £xc2± White has attacking chances with 
¤g5 or e4-e5-e6. 15...¢xf7 16.¤g5† ¢e8 17.£e6†  1–0 Black resigned due to: 17...¢d8 
18.¤f7† ¢c7 19.£d6 mate


590. Mikhail Tal – Wladyslaw Schinzel, Warsaw (simul) 1966
20.¤g4! ¤xg4 21.£xh7†  ¢f8 White has several ways to continue his winning attack; the 
famous attacker Tal unsurprisingly chose the strongest one: 22.£h8† ¢e7 23.£xg7+– White 
has threats against e6 and g4 (1–0, 29 moves). 23.¥xe6 fxe6 24.£xg7† is also winning for White, 
but not as clearly.


591. Mikhail Tal – Svend Hamann, Kislovodsk 1966
17.e5!+–  White lands first, before Black can put a pawn on e5. It’s over – the dark squares are 
too weak. No variations needed.


592. Mikhail Tal – Mato Damjanovic, Sarajevo 1966
28.¥xa4! ¦da8 29.¥xb5! Only like so – otherwise the first move would have been a mistake. 
29...¥xb5 29...¦xa3 30.¦xa3 ¦xa3 31.¥xc4+–  30.¦xa6  ¦xa6 31.¦xa6 ¥xa6+– The 
endgame should be easily winning, at least for a world-class player (1–0, 35 moves).


593. Erling Kristiansen – Mikhail Tal, Havana (ol) 1966
25...¦xc4! 25...exf5? 26.¥xf7†! ¢xf7 27.£b3† ¢f8 28.£xa4µ is also strong, but losing 
the f-pawn is totally unnecessary. 26.¦xc4 exf5–+  Black wins the pawns on e5 and d6 
 
(0–1, 35 moves).


594. Mikhail Tal – Svetozar Gligoric, Budva 1967
White is an exchange up for a pawn, but if he has to start retreating his pieces, Black will have 
sufficient counterplay. For that reason, forceful action is called for, taking advantage of the 
unprotected rook on a8. 27.¥xg7! ¥xg7 28.¦xg7† £xg7 29.£d5† 29.£xf5 is also winning, as 
the knight will have to be sacrificed to avoid losing the rook anyway. 29...¢h7 30.£xa8  White 
is clearly winning, but fell for a drawing trick in the end (½-½, 53 moves). 


595. Lajos Portisch – Mikhail Tal, Moscow 1967
16.b6!+–  The knight on a5 is trapped and is lost after 17.£c3 (1–0, 24 moves).


596. Mikhail Tal – Evgeni Vasiukov, Kharkov 1967
34.c7! 34.¥xc4± 34...¦e8! 34...¦c8 35.¦b8 ¤b6 36.¥e6+–  35.¦b8 ¤b6 36.¥a4! ¦c8 
37.¥d7!  34.c7 would have been bad if this 37th move did not exist (1–0, 40 moves).


597. Mikhail Tal – Alexander Cherepkov, Alma-Ata 1968
22.¥xh7†! ¢xh7 The game was 22...¢f8 23.¥e4± (1–0, 32 moves). 23.£c2† ¢g8 24.dxe6  
fxe6+– It is only a positional advantage, but it’s a great one.


598. Bent Larsen – Mikhail Tal, Eersel (5) 1969
31.¦xg7†! ¢xg7 31...¦xg7?? 32.£e8 mate  32.¦c7! ¥d7! 32...¦xc7? 33.¤xc7+–  33.¦xd7 
The queen on e3 survives – the point of White’s double-rook sacrifice. 33...¦xd7÷  White 
should exchange queens to safeguard his king, with an okay position despite the knight in the 
corner. In the game, White instead went for the greedy 34.£xa7? and lost (0–1, 40 moves).


599. Vladimir Tukmakov – Mikhail Tal, Moscow 1969
27...¤xg4! 28.fxg4 White instead resigned after 28.¤e4 ¤e5. 28...£f2† 29.¢h3 29.¢h1 £f3 
mate  29...£f3† 30.¢h4 £xg4 mate 


600. Mikhail Tal – Alexey Suetin, Tbilisi 1969
20.£xe5! dxe5 21.exf7† ¢d7 21...¢f8 22.¥h6 mate  is short, and 21...¢d8 leaves White 
to choose his preferred route to victory, one being: 22.f8=£† ¦xf8 23.¦xf8† ¢d7 24.¦xa8+– 
22.¥f5†! A double check; Black has to give up too much material. 22...¢c6 23.¥e4†  ¤d5 
24.¦xd5 White wins the queen with a decisive material advantage. 24.¥xd5† ¢d7 25.¥xa8†+– 
is also good enough.


601. Mikhail Tal – Viktor Korchnoi, Herceg Novi (blitz) 1970
23.£e8! White threatens 24.¦d8. 23...¦af7 23...¢g8 prepares to escape via f7, but that dream 
comes to an end after 24.¥d5†! ¢h8 25.¥c4+– . 24.¦d8+–  It is not possible to defend 
against both 25.¦xc8 and 25.£xf7. Also good enough is 24.¦d5 £b6 25.£xf7+–, and 24.£xf7 
¦xf7 25.¦d8† ¦f8 26.¦ee8 g6 27.¦xf8† ¢g7 28.¦xc8 wins as well, but is slightly unnecessary.


602. Gedeon Barcza – Mikhail Tal, Tallinn 1971
9...¥h3! 10.¤fxd4 10.0–0 allows the most resistance: 10...¤xf3† 11.¥xf3 ¥xf1µ But 10.¥xh3 
¤xf3† 11.¢f1 ¤xd2†–+  offers no resistance. 10...¥xg2 11.¦g1 exd4–+  Black has won a 
piece (0–1, 23 moves).


603. Mikhail Tal – Andres Vooremaa, Tallinn 1971
27.¤e6†! The black queen is shut out from the defence of the rook on f7. 27...dxe6 The game 
ended: 27...£xe6 28.fxe6 ¦xf6 29.¦f7 1–0 28.¦xf7 ¤xf7 29.£xf8† ¢c7 30.£xf7†+–  
 
The f-pawn queens.


604. Karoly Honfi – Mikhail Tal, Sukhumi 1972
30...¦xc3† 31.¢xc3 ¥b4†! 31...¦c8† 32.¢d2+– and the king escapes. 32.¢xb4 32.¢c4 £a6† 
33.¢xb4 £xe2–+  (or 32...¦b8 mating) 32...£a5† 33.¢c4 £a6†–+ 0–1


605. Mikhail Tal – Leonid Shamkovich, Baku 1972
20.¥xh7! ¢xh7 20...f5 21.£h4 was quite hopeless (1–0, 26 moves). Both 21.£h5 and 21.£h3 
also win, but the latter makes little sense. 21.¦f3  Mate is on the way. 21.¦d3 also wins.


606. Mikhail Tal – Valeri Korensky, Sochi 1973
20.¤xg7! ¤xg7 21.£g3! 21.£g4? ¥f6 22.¤f5 ¥e6–+ pins the knight. 21...¥g5 21...¥f6 
22.¤f5+–  22.¥xg5 f6 23.¥h6± White has won a pawn and weakened the enemy’s king’s 
position (1–0, 41 moves).


607. Mikhail Tal – William Hartston, Hastings 1973
24.¦xf7! ¦xf7 24...¢xf7 25.¥xg6† ¢g8 26.£h7 mate  25.¥xg6 ¤f5 The best try. 26.¥xf7† 
¢xf7 27.£h7†  1–0 Black loses the queen if he goes to the eighth rank, and is mated after: 
27...¤g7 (27...¢e8 28.£xh5† ¢f8 29.£h8†+–) 28.¦f1†


608. Michael Basman – Mikhail Tal, Hastings 1973
28.¦xf7! ¦xf7 28...£xf7 29.¥d5! £xd5 30.£g7 mate ; 28...£xe3† 29.¢h1 ¦xf7 30.£xb8† 
¥e8 (30...£e8 31.£xe8† ¥xe8 32.¥d5  should be winning as well) 31.¥d5+–  The king 
gets a square and the black rook is pinned. White must still take some care, but he is winning. 
29.£xb8†  ¥e8 29...¦f8 30.£a7 is important, defending the e3-pawn. 30.¥d4! Defending 
against 30...£xe3† 31.¢h1 ¤f2†. 30...axb2± White is close to winning if he plays accurately, 
but it’s difficult in practical play. Still it’s a good outcome from the diagram position. Basman 
played 31.¦d1, and 31.¦f1 was also a reasonable alternative.


609. Mikhail Tal – Paul Keres, Tallinn 1973
17...¤h4! The only move that saves the trapped queen. 18.gxh4 18.¥xf3? ¤xf3† 19.¢g2 
¤xd2–+  wins a piece. 18...£h3 19.¤f6†! White had to do something before Black took on 
h4. 19...gxf6! 19...¢h8?! 20.¤xe8± was the game (1–0, 45 moves). 20.£xh6 exd4! Stopping 
21.¦e3. 21.¢h1! 21.cxd4 ¤xd4 22.¦e3 ¤f5! 23.exf5 ¦xe3µ 21...¤e5! 22.¦g1† ¥g4! 22...¤g4? 
23.¥xg4 ¥xg4 24.¦g3!+– 23.¦g3! a) White has a narrow way to draw with: 23.cxd4 ¤f3! 24.¦g2 
¦xe4 25.¥b3! ¤xh4 26.¦g3 ¦ce8 27.¦ag1! ¦e1 28.¥xf7†! ¢xf7 29.£h7† ¢f8 30.£h8† ¢f7= 
b) 23.¥xg4?! ¤xg4 24.¦xg4† (24.¦g3?? £xh2 mate – this is the reason why White should start 
with ¦g3 on the 23rd move) 24...£xg4 25.¦g1 £xg1†³ 23...£f1† 24.¦g1 £h3= Black should 
have seen about this far before getting his queen trapped on f3, but from the diagram position, 
Black has no choice but to go for 17...¤h4 and make it up along the way. So you don’t need to 
see anything of this to get full points.


610. Mikhail Tal – Michael Stean, Moscow 1975
18.¤xh6†! gxh6 19.£g6† ¢h8 19...¥g7 20.¥xf7†  ¢f8 21.¥xh6! (21.¥f4 seems almost as 
strong and simpler: 21...¦e7 22.¥d6±) 21...¥xh6 22.¥d5! £e7 23.£xh6† £g7± With Black’s 
king in mind, White should keep the queens on. 20.¥xf7+–  There is no defence against 
21.¥xh6. If 20...¦h5 then White wins by challenging the knight on f6 in some fashion. In the 
game, Black tried 20...¦c6 and was immediately rewarded: 21.¦d5? ¦xe3! (which he didn’t play) 
22.fxe3 ¥g7!÷ Instead, 21.¥f4!, 21.¥xh6 and 21.¤d5 are all winning.


611. Oleg Romanishin – Mikhail Tal, Tallinn 1977
29.¤xh6! White gets a third pawn for the exchange with a continuing attack, since 29...¢xh6 
30.£h4† wins the rook: 30...¢g6 31.£g4† ¢h6 32.£xf3+– 


612. Mikhail Tal – Tamaz Giorgadze, Minsk 1979
39...¦xg3†! Opening up the second rank to take advantage of the unprotected rook on c2. 
40.fxg3 ¦e2† 41.¢h1 41.¢g1 ¤f3†–+  0–1 There are several ways to clinch the attack. The 
fastest is 41...¢h3 with mate coming.


613. Mikhail Tal – Boris Spassky, Tilburg 1980
38.¦g5†! ¢f7 38...fxg5 39.£xg5† ¢h8 40.£h6† ¢g8 41.£h7 mate  39.¥g6†+–  Tal won 
the queen (1–0, 46 moves).


614. Mikhail Tal – Rico Mascarinas, Lvov 1981
28.¥c7! The bishop moves with tempo to clear the way for the queen. 28...£xc7 29.¦h8† 
 
Or 29.£h6+–. 29...¢xh8 30.£h6† ¢g8 31.£h7† ¢f8 32.£h8 mate 


615. Jan Ambroz – Mikhail Tal, Riga 1981
36...¤xe4! 37.£xe4 37.f3–+ was played in the game (0–1, 40 moves). 37...d5µ  A double 
attack regaining the piece with an extra pawn and bishop versus knight.


616. Mikhail Tal – David Bronstein, Tbilisi (simul match) 1982
30.¤g6†! Preparing a square for the rook. 30...hxg6 31.£d8† ¢g7 32.¦xg6† ¢h7 33.£g8 
mate 


617. Mikhail Tal – Jim Plaskett, Sochi 1984
14.¥xh6! ¥xd5 14...gxh6 15.£g6†  ¢h8 16.¦xf6+– 15.cxd5 ¤b4 16.£g6!+–  White has 
won a pawn and has the bishop pair and more active position (1–0, 24 moves).


618. Mikhail Tal – Alexander Shabalov, Jurmala 1985
26.¤xe6! fxe6 26...¦xd2 27.¥xd2+–  with threats against the queen and rook. 27.¦xd8 ¥xd8 
28.£xd8  With a clearly winning position for White (1–0, 39 moves).


619. Zoltan Ribli – Mikhail Tal, Montpellier 1985
26...¦xf3! 27.¤xf3 27.¢xf3 £d3†!–+  wins the rook on d1. 27...£xd1–+ 


620. Mikhail Tal – Lembit Oll, Riga 1986
14.c5! The move ¤e6 would be mate if it were not for the queen, so White starts harassing 
Her Majesty. 14...¤xc5 The alternatives lead to mate: 14...£xc5 15.¤e6 mate  or 14...£a6 
15.¥a5† £xa5 16.¤e6 mate . 15.¥a5!  Only like so. 15...exd4+– Or 15...£xa5 16.¤e6 
mate. In the game, Black had three pieces for the queen, but no development and the king in the 
centre (1–0, 22 moves).


621. Mikhail Tal – Ovidiu Foisor, Tbilisi 1986
18.e5! ¤d5 18...¥xg2 19.exf6+–  with a double threat. 19.¢xg2 also wins material – either 
a pawn or an exchange: 19...¤d7 20.exd6 ¥g5± 19.¤xd5 Tal played the weaker 19.¥xd5 exd5 
20.¤xd5 ¥g5± (1–0, 27 moves). 19...exd5 20.¥xd5+–  White won a pawn and will win a 
second one on d6, or an exchange.


622. Mikhail Tal – Miguel Quinteros, Santiago del Estero (blitz) 1987
21.¦xf5! gxf5 22.¤ce4! 1–0 After 22...fxe4 23.¦f1  there is no defence against 24.¦xf6 exf6 
25.£xh7 mate.


623. Mikhail Tal – Johann Hjartarson, Reykjavik 1987
39.¤cxe5! 39.¦xa8 ¤xa8 40.¤cxe5! avoids the counterplay Black tried in the game, but it is not 
so easy to evaluate the position after 40...dxe5 41.£xe5† ¢f8 42.d6. However, White is winning 
here too. 39...£d1† 39...dxe5 40.£xe5† ¤f6 (40...¢f7 41.¤g5 mate) 41.£e7†+–  40.¢h2 
¦a1 41.¤g4†! ¢f7 42.¤h6† ¢e7 43.¤g8† For aesthetic reasons, Tal could have given up his 
queen: 43.£g7† ¤xg7 44.¤g8† ¢f7 45.¤g5 mate. 43...¢f7 44.¤g5 mate 


624. Mikhail Tal – Eduard Meduna, Germany 1989
11.¤xf7! 11.¥xe6 fxe6 12.¤xe6 is also a serious advantage for White. 11...¢xf7 The game went: 
11...£c7 12.¥xe6 (1–0, 20 moves) 12.¦xe6!  12.¤g5† ¢e8 13.¤xe6+– is also strong enough, 
even though White has to play some more good moves. 12...£b4 Or 12...£xe6 13.¤g5†+–. 
The b4-square is the only way to escape from the discovered check, but White has many winning 
moves, among them 13.¦xf6† ¢xf6 14.£xd4† with mate.


625. Soenke Maus – Mikhail Tal, Germany 1990
24.¤bxd5! Taking advantage of the unprotected bishops and exposed queen. 24.¤fxd5 leads 
to the same. 24...exd5 25.¤xd5 £d6 26.¤xf6† £xf6 27.£xd7+–  White is winning, but 
blundered on the next move (0–1, 28 moves).


626. Mikhail Tal – Vladimir Akopian, Barcelona 1992
32.£e5†! White wins with a discovered check on the next move. 32...¦g7 33.¦d8† ¦xd8 
34.£xc3+–  (1–0, 38 moves)


627. Malashkhia – Tigran Petrosian, Tbilisi 1944
17.f6! ¥xf6 17...¤xf6 is a better try, but White is much better after 18.¤d5! £xa2 19.¤xe7† 
¢h8 20.¥xf6±  or 20.¦xf6±. 18.¦xf6! ¤xf6 19.¤d5  1–0 Black resigned due to 19...£xa2 
20.¤xe7† ¢g7 21.¤d5 with a deadly attack.


628. Agamalian – Tigran Petrosian, Tbilisi 1944
26...¤xb3! 27.¥b2 27.¥xb3 ¥xf3†  (27...¦xf1?! 28.¢xf1 ¥xf3µ is also good, but it is better to 
keep control over the c-file) 28.¢g1–+ Black is a healthy pawn up with a positional advantage to 
boot. 27...¦b1! Black has to stay on the first rank. It seems unnecessary to give away the bishop 
with: 27...¥xf3† 28.¢xf3 ¦b1µ 28.¥xb3 ¥xf3† 28...¦xf1 is a tempo worse, but also good 
enough. 29.¢g1 ¦xf1† 30.¢xf1µ  Black is a healthy pawn up (0–1, 56 moves).


629. Yury Vasilchuk – Tigran Petrosian, Leningrad 1945
39.£xg8! 0–1 Black resigned due to 39...¤xg8 40.h7+–  and the h-pawn queens.


630. Palavandishvili – Tigran Petrosian, Tbilisi 1945
Black is clearly better, but can push his advantage further with: 14...¤b4! 15.£b3 15.cxb4? 
allows 15...¦ac8–+  or 15...¦fc8–+. 15...¤xd3†–+ Trading off White’s bishop pair, which was 
his only compensation for his many pawn weaknesses.


631. Nersesov – Tigran Petrosian, Tbilisi 1945
Black is clearly better with, for example, 23...¦ab8µ, but he has a way to gain a winning position. 
23...¤e4! All the exposed white pieces make lovely targets for a centralized knight. 24.¦xd5 
24.¦c2 ¤xg3†–+  24...£xd5 Or 24...¤xg3†–+. 0–1 White resigned as 25.£xd5 ¤c3† gives 
Black an extra rook.


632. Nikolay Grigoriev – Tigran Petrosian, Tbilisi 1945
25...¦xe5†! Abandoning the bind on the queenside to go for the kill. 25...g6?!µ is not killing. 
26.¢f1 26.¢d1 £xf2! 27.£xb3 £e2† 28.¢c1 ¦c5† 29.£c4 ¦xc4†–+  30.dxc4 d3 31.b4 £c2 
mate 26...¦f5!  0–1 Mating.


633. Kristaps Smilga – Tigran Petrosian, Leningrad 1946
Black is already winning, but has a chance to finish the game quickly. 37...¦xa2! 38.£xa2 
b3 39.£b2 bxc2 40.£xc2 40.¢g1 can be met in many ways, including 40...£xd4 41.cxd4 
 
c1=£†–+ and 40.¦e1 also allows many wins, including 40...£d3–+. The queen infiltration is 
lethal. 40...£xd4!–+  0–1 (44 moves)


634. Tigran Petrosian – Yuri Kotkov, Leningrad 1946
White is a piece up, but it looks like he will lose the knight on c4. 19.¦xd7! 19.¤fe5 ¥xe5 
20.¤xe5 ¦xc2 21.¥xc2 is clearly better for White, since he holds onto the minor pieces after: 
21...£c7 22.¤xd7 ¦d8 23.¤c5! However, the game continuation is much clearer. 19...£xd7 
20.¤b6! 20.¤ce5± only gives two pieces for a rook and pawn. 20...¦xc2 20...£c7 21.¤xc8+–  
21.¤xd7  ¦c4 22.¤d2!+– The last difficult move, keeping the b-pawn on the board. 22.¤xf8?! 
¦xe4 allows Black to win the b-pawn, although White is winning anyway.


635. Tigran Petrosian – Genrikh Kasparian, Yerevan (1) 1946
28...¦xh3†! 28...¤xb1 29.£xa7 and Black cannot defend against White’s attack, but he has 
29...¦xh3† (either now or after 29...£b2/£b3 30.¥b4) 30.¢xh3 ¦h8† 31.¢g3 £b3† 32.¢g4 
£d1† (32...¤xd2 33.£a5 ¢b8! 34.£c7† is also a draw) 33.¢g3 with a draw. 29.gxh3 29.¢xh3 
£f5†!–+  and the knight fork on e2 is unavoidable. 29...¤xb1 30.¦xb1 30.£xa7 £xd2†–+  
comes with check, and Black gets the tempo he needs to check the queen to b5 and win. 
30...£xb1 31.£xa7 £b5! 32.¥a5 ¦e8!–+  The only winning move, since Black has to be able 
to protect the rook after £a8† (0–1, 39 moves).
 
636. Tigran Petrosian – Manoian, Yerevan 1948
32...£g7?? The idea is to be able to play ...¢g8, but the attack is irresistible with the white rook 
on h6. 32...¢g8!–+  is the solution, and a type of move that’s often overlooked, simply moving 
the king out of the way in anticipation of a check. 33.¦xh6† ¢g8 34.£e6†+– White has a 
winning attack (1–0, 40 moves). 34.£xd5†+– also wins.


637. Alexander Kotov – Tigran Petrosian, Moscow 1949
8.¥xe7! £xe7?! 8...¢xe7 9.¤xe4 dxe4 10.£xe4†±  9.¤xd5! Taking full advantage of Black’s 
premature knight jump to e4. 9...cxd5 10.£xc8†+–  White is winning; Black resigned in a 
few moves.


638. Tigran Petrosian – Alexey Sokolsky, Moscow 1949
17.¥xf7†! ¢xf7 18.£b3† ¦e6 19.£xd3±  White has won a pawn (½–½, 51 moves).


639. Boris Ratner – Tigran Petrosian, Gorky 1950
30...¤a4! 30...¥xd4 31.¥xd4³ 31.bxa4 £xb2 32.¥xb2 ¥xd4–+  After a series of forced moves, 
Black is an exchange up for a pawn, but also has much more active play and fewer weaknesses.


640. Tigran Petrosian – Ratmir Kholmov, Vilnius 1951
34...¤xf2! 35.¦b7? a) 35.¢xf2 ¦xd1–+ and the pin along the second rank makes Black’s day. 
 
b) 35.£xd5 ¤xd1–+  and the knight cannot be taken due to 36...£b6† picking up the rook, so 
Black has two extra pawns and an initiative. c) 35.¦b1! was the only move. 35...¤xe4 36.¦xb2µ 
With the rook on a7, White has hopes of attacking a5 or f7. 35...¦xd1†  Or 35...¤xe4–+. 
36.¥xd1 £d2–+ (0–1, 43 moves) 36...¤xe4–+ was also winning.


641. Herman Pilnik – Tigran Petrosian, Budapest 1952
36.¥xc6! 36.hxg4!? fxg4 37.¥xc6! could be a slight improvement, as White has less to worry 
about on the first rank. But the game move is good enough. 36...¢g7 36...¦xc6 37.d7+–  
queens. After having moved the king, Black threatens 37...¦xc6 38.d7 ¦fd6 39.cxd6 ¦xd6 with 
drawing chances. 37.¦e7†!  The game continued: 37.d7 ¦fxc6! 38.dxc8=£ ¦xc8 39.b4 The 
rook ending should be winning, but it is not over yet (1–0, 50 moves). Instead, checking on e7 
is accurate when Black’s king cannot go to f6. The two pawns, supported by bishop and rook, 
are strong enough to gain a winning rook endgame, for instance: 37...¢f8!? 38.¦e5 ¦xc6 39.d7 
¦fd6 40.¦xf5† ¢g7 41.¦g5† ¢h6 42.cxd6 g3 43.¢f1 ¦xd6 44.¦g4+–


642. Tigran Petrosian – Ludek Pachman, Saltsjobaden 1952
24.£xg6! 24.¤e7†?! £xe7 25.£xg6± is not as good. With queens on the board, Black has some 
chances to get his pieces working properly. 24...£xg6 25.¤e7† ¢f7 26.¤xg6 ¢xg6+–  
The minor pieces are no match for so many pawns on the kingside (1–0, 36 moves).


643. Zdravko Milev – Tigran Petrosian, Bucharest 1953
24...¤xg3! Using the back-rank weakness to create a winning attack. 24...¤g5? does not work 
due to the defence 25.¤d2!+– and the knight is trapped on g5. 25.¦xe8† Instead the game went: 
25.¤c3 bxc3 26.hxg3 c2–+ 25...¦xe8 26.hxg3 ¦e1† 27.¢h2 £e2† 28.¢h3 ¦h1 mate 


644. Laszlo Szabo – Tigran Petrosian, Zurich 1953
28...¥f6! Trying to chase away a defender of c4. 29.e5 The only serious move, which White 
had surely planned in advance. 29...¥xe5!  But the pinned knight is not an effective defender, 
as it cannot move! 30.¦e4 ¤f6–+ The rook cannot maintain its defence of c4 and 31.¦xe5 
¦xc4 32.¦xc4 £xc4 33.£xc4 ¦xc4 is a decisive double threat. 30...f6–+ or 30...¥xh2† 31.¢h1 
¤f6–+ does not spoil anything either.


645. Gideon Stahlberg – Tigran Petrosian, Zurich 1953
17...¥xh3 18.¢xh3 ¤xe4! Simply winning a central pawn; Black is much better. 19.¤xe4 
£f5† 20.¢h2 £xe4µ  (0–1, 64 moves)


646. Mark Taimanov – Tigran Petrosian, Zurich 1953
24.¥a4! Since the queen needs to remain in control of d8, White wins material. After 24.g4?! 
g6± White is still clearly better, but Black has hope. 24...¥d7 Black played 24...¦d7+– (1–0, 
40 moves). 25.e6! Now the queen has to allow the decisive £d8†. Instead 25.¦h3!? h6 (25...g6 
26.e6 £xe6 27.¦e1+–) 26.¥d1, infiltrating the light squares, is also good. 25...£xe6 26.£d8† 
Or 26.¦e1+–. 26...£e8 27.£xe8† ¥xe8 28.¥xe8+– 


647. Svetozar Gligoric – Tigran Petrosian, Belgrade 1954
33.¦xg5†! 33.¦xf6?!= 33...¢f7 33...fxg5 34.£xf8 mate  34.¦xf6† Forcing mate, while several 
other moves also win. The best alternative is 34.¤e5†+–. 34...¢xf6 35.£xf8†! ¢xg5 36.h4†! 
1–0 It’s mate: 36...¢xh4 37.£f4 mate  or 36...¢g6 37.¤f4 mate .


648. Tigran Petrosian – Pal Benko, Budapest 1955
18.¤xe5! Black is surely missing his dark-squared bishop now! 18...£xe5 19.¥g3 £e7 20.e5! 
¦d7 21.¦xf6+–  White is clearly winning – the central pawns and bishop pair reign supreme 
(1–0, 27 moves).


649. Tigran Petrosian – Alexander Tolush, Riga 1958
29.¥f1! The bishop manoeuvre to the a2-g8 diagonal wins at least the f5-pawn, with a completely 
winning position. 29.¥h3 tries to provoke ...g6 before manoeuvring the bishop to c4, but Black 
has 29...¦d7 in between, when the queen has no good square. 30.£f1 g6 31.¦xe4 fxe4 32.¥xd7 
£xd7 33.£c4† £f7 34.£xf7† ¢xf7 35.¦xc5 wins a pawn, but it’s not over yet. 29...¢h8 
30.¥c4+–  White is winning; here are some sample lines: 30...£f6 30...£d7 31.¥e6 £xd1† 
32.¦xd1+–; 30...£g6 31.¦e6 ¤f6 32.£d6+– and Black has lost all active counterplay while 
White’s pieces have gained in strength. 31.¦e8 ¦xe8 32.¥xf6+– (1–0, 37 moves)


650. Tigran Petrosian – Eduard Gufeld, Tbilisi 1959
23.¤xd5! exd5 24.£xe8+–  The queen cannot be taken, so White has gained a winning 
advantage with his extra pawn and better pieces (1–0, 30 moves).


651. Leonid Stein – Tigran Petrosian, Moscow 1961
26.¥xe6! Black resigned. 26.¦xf7? ¦xf7 27.¥xe6 leads nowhere after: 27...¦xf1† 28.£xf1 £e7µ 
And 26.¥h5 ¤h8!= is equal. 26...fxe6 Or 26...¤h8 when White, among others, has 27.£g4!+–. 
27.£g4!+–  The knight cannot move because of ¦f8†, so Black is totally lost.


652. Tigran Petrosian – Paul Keres, Zurich 1961
22...£xd1! 22...¤f3†? 23.¦xf3 £xd1† 24.¢g2± is a lot worse, since White retains attacking 
chances with the queens still on and has a double attack with the bishop. 23.¦xd1 ¤f3† 24.¢g2 
¤xh4† 25.¥xh4µ  Black’s pieces are not impressive, and the d6-pawn is quite useless, so it is 
not over yet, but winning an exchange is of course a good start (0–1, 50 moves).


653. Semen Furman – Tigran Petrosian, Moscow 1961
31...¤xh3†! 32.gxh3 32.¢h2 ¤xf2–+ was hopeless in the game (0–1, 41 moves). 32...¤f3† 
33.¢h1 ¤xe1–+ 


654. Tigran Petrosian – Georgi Ilivitzki, Moscow) 1964
White has a clear positional advantage after most moves, but can use his superiority to gain a 
decisive material advantage. 22.¤xg7! ¢xg7 23.g5+–  White wins an important pawn, or 
more. The opening of the g-file secures the pawn that will arrive on f6. 23...¤8d7 24.£xd5 1–0


655. Tigran Petrosian – Leonid Stein, Moscow 1967
Sometimes the best you can do is make a draw. 25.¤xe5! 25.¤h2 ¤g4µ 25...£h3 25...¤g4? 
26.¥xg4 fxg4 27.¤xd7  ¦f7 28.e5!± The knight gets out with an extra piece, or White gets 
a very strong passed pawn on e6. 25...£g5 should be met with 26.¤f3=, as White is worse 
after other moves. The challenge with this exercise is to realize that White is satisfied with a 
draw. 26.¥f1 26.¤xd7? ¥e3!!µ 26...£h5 27.¥e2 White can also play on with 27.¤xd7 ¤xd7 
28.exf5= but should probably try the same repetition soon. 27...£h3 28.¥f1 £h5  ½–½


656. Tigran Petrosian – Aron Reshko, Leningrad 1967
28.¦xg6†! The only move that is not worse for White. 28.¦xd2? £xd2 29.¦xg6†µ allows Black 
to move the king, as the pawn on h6 is defended. It is also a huge difference that Black threatens 
to check (and mate). 28...fxg6 28...¢f8? 29.¦xh6± (or 29.¦g8† ¢xg8 30.£g4† ¢f8 31.£xc8† 
¢e7±, or 29.¦f1±) 29.£b7† ¢h8 ChessBase gives 29...¢g8? but it seems unlikely, as it allows 
30.¥b3† with mate. 30.£xc8†÷  The game should end in a draw, but Black made a mistake 
and lost (1–0, 40 moves).


657. Tigran Petrosian – Jonathan Penrose, Palma de Mallorca 1969
38.¤e7†! 38.£b5+– is a positional win – White still has the same threat. 38...£xe7 39.£a6† 
¢g7 40.£xc8+– 


658. Tigran Petrosian – Boris Spassky, Moscow (4) 1969
38...¥d3! The queen is obstructed from the defence of the d-pawn. 39.¤f5 39.£c3 £h4 40.¢g1 
¥xf1! Black wins. 41.¦c8 (no better are 41.¢xf1 £h3† 42.¢f2 £g2 mate or 41.¤xf1 ¤e2†–+) 
41...¥b5!–+  The light-squared bishop does a good job. 39...£g5! The threats are 40...¤h3† 
and 40...¥xf5 followed by 41...£h4†. 39...¥xf5 40.£xf4 g5 also wins – White has to give up 
the d- or the g-pawns (also full points). 40.¤e3 £h4† 41.¢g1 ¥xf1–+  0–1 White resigned 
due to 42.¤xf1 ¦e2 43.£xf4 £f2† 44.¢h1 £xf1 mate and 42.¢xf1 £h3† 43.¢g1 £xf3 with 
mate coming soon.


659. Tigran Petrosian – Vladimir Savon, Moscow 1969
29.e5!  Preparing a check on f3. But not 29.¦f3? £xf3! 30.gxf3 ¦h8=. 29...£xe5 30.¥h6+– 
1–0 There is no defence against 31.¦f3†. Petrosian’s 30.¦f3† ¢e6 31.£xg6† ¥f6 was also 
winning, but required some more moves (1–0, 37 moves).


660. Lev Polugaevsky – Tigran Petrosian, Soviet Union 1970
23...¥xd2! 24.£xd2 £xg3†! 24...¦xe4µ If you saw the queen sacrifice, winning a pawn, but still 
decided to keep the queens on the board, you get full points. 25.¢xg3 ¤xe4† 26.¢f4 ¤xd2–+  
After 27.¦fe1, Black played 27...¤f6 to get the knight out in a good way.


661. Rudolf Maric – Tigran Petrosian, Vinkovci 1970
22.¥xf7! White is better after other moves, but this wins. 22...¦xf7 23.¤e6†! ¢g8 24.¤xc7+–  
The final moves were: 24...¥f8 25.¤e8 ¢h7 26.¦xd7 1–0


662. Tigran Petrosian – Anthony Saidy, San Antonio 1972
Black is trying to equalize by trading rooks, but he forgot about his queen. 21.¥d3! £d5 
22.¥h7†! ¢xh7 23.¦xd5+–  (1–0, 56 moves)


663. Tigran Petrosian – Miguel Quinteros, Manila 1974
38.f4! Driving away the best defender of d6. 38...gxf4 39.gxf4 ¥b2 40.¦xd6! 40.¥xb2 £xb2 
41.¦xd6 £b1† 42.¢h2 £xf5 43.¦xh6+– should also win, but it’s only a pawn. 40...¦e8 
40...£xd6 41.¥xc5+–  41.¦xf6 1–0


664. Tigran Petrosian – Radolfo Cardoso, Manila 1974
36.¦h7†! 36.£h6†? ¢f7 37.£h7†? ¢e6–+ 36...¢xh7 37.¤xf6† ¢g7 38.¤xg4+– 


665. Tigran Petrosian – Bukhuti Gurgenidze, Riga 1975
19.¤xd6! White did not have to respond to the threat to the bishop by moving it. 19...hxg5 
19...£xd6? 20.¥xe7 £xe7 21.d6† £f7 22.¥d5+–  20.¤xb5+– (1–0, 31 moves) 20.¤xb7+– 
also wins if White follows up with 21.d6†.


666. Tigran Petrosian – Nigel Short, London (simul) 1978
37...¦xg6! In order to exploit White’s weak king, Black needs to get at the d4-pawn with 
the bishop. So 37...¤xg6 38.¦xf6 ¥xf6 39.¥xg6÷ is not enough. 38.£h5 Three alternatives: 
 
a) 38.¥xg6 ¤xg6 39.¤xg6 ¥xd4†–+  b) 38.¤xg6 ¥xd4†–+  c) 38.¦f7 ¦h6! 39.£xh6 ¥xh6 
40.¥h7† ¢h8 41.¦xe7 £xe7 42.¤g6† ¢xh7 43.¤xe7–+  is just a piece up for Black (and there 
were no good alternatives on the way). 38...¦h6! 38...¥xe5?! 39.¦xe5± 39.£f7† ¢h8  0–1 
White is a piece down.


667. Gerardo Lebredo Zarragoitia – Tigran Petrosian, Vilnius 1978
Black can win with many moves, but a mate-in-four should not be missed: 32...¤g4†! 33.hxg4 
¦f1!  0–1


668. Lev Polugaevsky – Tigran Petrosian, Kislovodsk 1982
24.¤d5! exd5 a) 24...£xd6 25.¤f6†+–  wins the queen. b) Black tried to fight on with 
24...£c5 but did not last long: 25.¤c7+– (or 25.¤e7† ¥xe7 26.£xe6†+–, or even 25.£c2+–) 
25.¥xd5†  It is mate on the next move.


669. Boris Spassky – Vladlen Zurakhov, Leningrad 1954
29.¤xf6!+– Black can’t take back, as 29...gxf6 30.£xf6†  ¢g8 31.¦d7 leads to mate.


670. Semen Furman – Boris Spassky, Moscow 1955
Black is threatening 24...f4 followed by 25...¤g3† 26.hxg3 ¦h6 mate. 24.¦ab1 is better for White, 
but allows Black to complicate things with: 24...¦b6 25.£xa7 ¤g3† 26.hxg3 ¦h6† 27.¥xh6 
£xa7 28.¦xb5 gxh6± So the solution is another move: 24.¥e3! £e5 24...£xe3 25.¥xc4†+–  is 
a discovered attack and 24...¦c7 25.¥xc5 ¦xb7 26.¦ab1 wins a second pawn with a capture on 
b5 next. 25.f4+– White threatens not only the queen, but also the knight on h5.


671. Boris Spassky – Mark Taimanov, Moscow 1955
15.¤xb5! axb5 16.£h5† Or 16.¦xa8† first. 16...£f7 17.¦xa8† ¥xa8 18.¦d8†! ¢xd8 19.£xf7 
gxh4  Black has a rook, a bishop and a knight for the queen, but his pieces are passive and his 
pawns are falling. White is clearly winning. Spassky took the pawns on f6, e5, b5 and c7, and 
continued with b3-b4-b5-b6-b7-b8=£ (1–0, 39 moves).


672. Nikolai Krogius – Boris Spassky, Leningrad 1957
39...¥d5†! 40.¢g3 ¤e2† 41.¢h3 ¤xf4† An even faster move is 41...¥f2 when White cannot 
defend against both 42...¤xf4 mate and 42...¤xg1 mate. 42.¢g3 ¤e2†  43.¢h3 ¤g1† 
44.¢g3 f4† 45.¢xf4 ¤e2 mate


673. David Bronstein – Boris Spassky, Riga 1958
20...¤f3†! Black could also start with 20...£b5–+ and execute the winning combination 
on the next move. 21.gxf3 £g5†  22.¢h1 22.¦g4 ¤xg4 23.fxg4 £xe7–+ leaves Black an 
exchange up, with the safer king. 22...£xh4–+ Spassky easily converted his material advantage 
 
(0–1, 30 moves).


674. Boris Spassky – Fridrik Olafsson, Moscow 1959
34.¦g8†! ¢h7 34...¦xg8 35.£xh6 mate  35.¦2g7†! Or 35.¦8g7†. 35...£xg7 36.¦xg7† 
¢xg7 37.f6† 37.£g5† gives the same result. 37...¤xf6 38.£g5† ¢h7 39.£xf6  White is 
winning and Black resigned after: 39...¦e5 40.¥xe4† 1–0


675. Igor Zaitsev – Boris Spassky, Rostov on Don 1960
23.£c4! The black queen is overloaded and cannot defend both h1 and h4. 23...£xc4 24.¦h1† 
¢g8 25.¦h8 mate 


676. Boris Spassky – Vladimir Shishkin, Rostov on Don 1960
White’s pawns on the kingside are decisive, but first he must defend against the mate. 35.¥f4! 
£xf4 36.£b6† 36.£b5† ¢a7 should be winning, but is less clear. 36...¢c8 36...¢a8 drops the 
rook with check: 37.£xd8†+–  37.£xb4+–  Now it is the black king that is exposed; there is 
no defence against 38.¦c1†.


677. Boris Spassky – Alberto Foguelman, Mar del Plata 1960
25.¤xg6†! 25.¦c1 loses to 25...£xd6, but there is a way to move the rook from d6 with check. 
25...fxg6 26.¦d8† 26.£xg6? cxd1=£† 27.¦xd1 is not winning after 27...£f8!=. 26...¢g7 
26...¢h7 27.¦c1!+–  27.¦g8†!! 27.¦c1 also wins. 27...¢xg8 28.£xg6† ¦g7 Or 28...¢f8 
29.£f6† with mate (and 29.¦d8† also wins). 29.¦d8†  White wins the queen and can pick up 
the c2-pawn, with a winning material advantage. The game finished: 29...£f8 30.¦xf8† ¢xf8 
31.£xc2 ¢g8 32.£c5 1–0


678. Boris Spassky – Dragoljub Ciric, Marianske Lazne 1962
17.¦f4!  There are no other moves that do not lose, so you do not need to see further to get 
the full score. However, there is a little twist later. Instead 17.¥f4? ¦e3† wins for Black. 17...¥e6 
18.¤xe6 ¦xe6 Black threatens 19...g5, but 19.£xd6! £g6† 20.¦g4 is over and out, either with 
two bishops for a rook, or with 20...¦e3† 21.¥xe3 £xd6†+– and White has one piece too many 
for the queen (1–0, 29 moves).


679. Boris Spassky – Valery Bykov Leningrad 1963
26.¦xe4! ¦xe4 26...fxe4? 27.¥g4  traps the queen, or 27...¦e6 28.¦xb7!+– when Black 
will be a piece down. 27.¥xe4 fxe4 28.¤f6† ¦xf6 29.¥xf6+–  Black has lost an exchange 
 
(1–0, 40 moves).


680. Boris Spassky – Viktor Korchnoi, Moscow 1964
14.¤xd5! White threatens 15.¤c7 and 15.¤xf6† £xf6 16.¥xb7. 14...¥xd5 14...¥d8 15.¤f6† 
wins an exchange, but 15.¤c7 shows even less mercy; Black loses a piece. 15.¤f4! £d6+–  
White wins an exchange and the game after either capture on d5. But not 15...¥xg2? 16.¤xe6  
¥xf1 17.¤xf8 ¥h3 when Black temporarily gets three pieces for the queen, but his luck is short-
lived after (among others) 18.£d3 ¢xf8 19.£e4+– trapping the rook.


681. Boris Spassky – Gyozo Forintos, Sochi 1964
9.e6! ¥xe6 9...£xe6 10.¤g5+–  forks the queen and bishop. 10.¤e5! £d6 10...¤xe5 
11.£xb7 mate  11.¤xc6 11.¥f4 is also winning. 11...bxc6  White gains a winning attack 
after developing the pieces in almost any way. It would not even help Black if it was his move.


682. Boris Spassky – Kick Langeweg, Sochi 1967
25.¥xg7! £xd5 25...¥xg7 26.¤e7†+–  forks king and queen. 26.¤h6† 26.cxd5?! ¦c1† 
27.£f1 ¦xf1† 28.¢xf1 ¥xg7 29.¦g3 should also win in the end, but can be messed up by White 
for sure (so not full points). But 26.¥e5 forces Black to part with the queen and is good enough 
to win. 26...¢xg7 27.£g4† Black is mated in two moves. 27.¦g3† is a longer route to mate. 
27...¢f6 28.¤g8 mate 


683. Shimon Kagan – Boris Spassky, Winnipeg 1967
This exercise was in the book that Hans Tikkanen used the first time he tried the Woodpecker 
Method. 28...¤xe3! 29.¥xe3 29.¦xe3 £xf4†  30.¢e2 £h2† wins a piece. 29...¦xe3 30.¦xe3 
30.¢xe3 ¥xd4†! 31.¢xd4 £xf4†–+  and Black picks up the rook on g1. 30...£xf4† 31.¢e2 
Black wins back the exchange with interest after: 31...£h2† 32.¢f1 ¥xd4–+ 


684. Boris Spassky – Klaus Darga, Beverwijk 1967
21.¤g6! fxg6 22.¥xd5  ¦f6 The only move that holds onto the pawn, but Black has a bad 
pawn structure and is badly coordinated. Spassky continued with 23.¦ac1 and had a clear 
advantage (1–0, 33 moves). A combination doesn’t have to win material.


685. Istvan Csom – Boris Spassky, Amsterdam 1970
31...¦c7! The rook is on the way to b1. 32.¦d1 32.¦a1 ¦c2  33.g3 ¢f7 wins, as the king 
picks up the d-pawn and continues to b3. 32...¦c2 33.d6 ¦d2!  Only this move stops White’s 
d-pawn in time. 34.¦c1 ¢f7 0–1


686. Mark Taimanov – Boris Spassky Rostov on Don 1971
31...¦xd3! Setting up a double attack by deflecting the defender of the f3-rook. 32.exd3 32.£xd3 
loses after 32...£c8!–+  followed by 33...c2 (32...£c6? allows 33.¦bxf7! ¦xf7 34.£d8† ¢h7 
35.£d3† £g6 36.¦xf7 c2 37.¦c7 c1=£† 38.¦xc1 ¥xc1 39.¢f2 and we will not debate whether 
this is won or not). 32...£d5! The rooks cannot defend each other, and the b-pawn stays alive 
after the forced capture on b2. But not 32...£c6? 33.¦xb2=. 33.¦xb2 cxb2µ  Black has good 
winning chances and the game only lasted seven more moves: 34.¦f1 £e5 35.e4 ¦a8 36.£b3 
¦a1 37.¢g2 ¦c1 38.£xf7† ¢h7 39.¦f5 £d6 40.e5 0–1


687. Boris Spassky – Derek Banks, Vancouver 1971
33.¥xe6†! ¢xe6 33...¤xe6 34.£d7 mate  34.£b3†  White has a tremendous attack that 
wins in several ways. 34...¢d7 35.£xb7† 35.¥a3 and 35.£b5† are also winning. 35...¢e6 
36.¦d1 £xg4 37.£d5† 1–0 Black resigned with 37...¢f5 38.¦f1† ¢g6 39.£xg8†+– in mind.


688. Boris Spassky – Walter Dobrich, Vancouver 1971
17.b4!  Black’s pawn structure is undermined. The queen gets access to d4 if he captures, 
and ...d6xc5 would fatally open his king. 17...h4! Black is not lost yet, but is in grave danger 
after 17...¥b6 18.bxc5 ¥xc5 19.£f3 f5 20.¤xc5 dxc5± and d5-d6 now or later. 18.bxa5 hxg3 
19.¤xg3± White has won a pawn and Black’s counterplay is not impressive at all (1–0, 28 moves).


689. Boris Spassky – Robert Zuk, Vancouver 1971
40.¤g5! ¥c8 The only defence against 41.¦h3†. 40...¦h6 41.¤f7†+– and 40...¦xg5 41.£h4†  
(or 41.¦h3†+–) are hopeless. However, also after the game move White has a generally winning 
position. Strongest is 41.£e4+– threatening 42.¤e6 as a decisive discovered attack. Black will 
have to give up material to survive. 41.a5 is also definitely winning, but not the game move 
41.¤f7†?! as it allows 41...¢g8! (which was not played) 42.¤xe5† ¥e6± and Black has fighting 
chances only a pawn down.


690. Boris Spassky – Robert Fischer, Reykjavik (1) 1972
I expect that you recognized the first move, but it would have been a mistake were it not for 
a critical move later in the variation. 32.¢f3! Putting Black under pressure. Instead 32.gxh4 
should be a draw. 32...¢e7 The critical position arises after 32...h3 33.¢g4 ¥g1 34.¢xh3 ¥xf2 
when Fischer may have missed that the bishop is trapped after: 35.¥d2!+–  Zero points if you 
didn’t see this move! (Harsh – but on the other hand 32.gxh4 is worth one point.) 33.¢g2 hxg3 
34.fxg3 ¥xg3 35.¢xg3 ¢d6 36.a4 ¢d5 37.¥a3 ¢e4?! Fischer lost this famous game. 37...a6! 
has been analysed to a draw.


691. Boris Spassky – Robert Fischer, Reykjavik (5) 1972
27...¥xa4! 0–1 White resigned, since he is mated after 28.£xa4 £xe4 .


692. Boris Spassky – Heikki Westerinen, Dortmund 1973
23.¦xh5! ¦f8 23...¦xh5 24.£g8† ¢e7 25.exd6†!  followed by 26.¦e1† decides. Westerinen 
accepted his fate by not taking back on h5. White can continue forcefully by using the e-file, but 
Spassky’s 24.a4 is also good enough for a win.


693. Boris Spassky – Valeri Korensky, Sochi 1973
23.e7†! Black is mated in one move if he captures the pawn, and loses the f7-pawn with check if he 
does not. 23.£h8† ¢e7 24.¦xf7†? (24.£f6† ¢e8=) 24...¢d6–+ is not the way – White’s attack 
is over. 23...¢g8 23...¦xe7 24.£h8 mate  24.£xf7† ¢h8 25.e8=£† ¦xe8 26.£xe8†+–  
¢g7 27.£e5† ¢g8 28.£g5† 1–0 It’s mate in seven moves.


694. Boris Spassky – Ratmir Kholmov, Sochi 1973
27.¦xa8! The queen is removed from the defence of the g5-bishop. 27...¦xa8 28.¦xa8 £xa8 
29.¥xg5+–  (1–0, 41 moves)


695. Boris Rytov – Boris Spassky, Tallinn 1973
12...¤xe4! 13.£xe4 ¥xc3 14.¥g5 14.bxc3 ¥f5 and the queen can’t defend the rook on b1. It is 
not over yet though: 15.£e2 ¥xb1  16.g4!³ and Black has to sacrifice a pawn to get the bishop 
out. 14...¥e5³ Black is a healthy pawn up.


696. Boris Spassky – Orest Averkin, Moscow 1973
26.¥c7! ¦xc7 27.£e5 The double threat against c7 and g7 picks up an exchange. 27...¢f8 
28.£xc7± 


697. Bojan Kurajica – Boris Spassky, Solingen 1974
23...¥h3! 24.¥h1!µ Despite being a pawn down, White has decent chances to hold with the 
opposite-coloured bishops, and Kurajica managed to do so. 24.¥xh3 is met by 24...¦xe4 mate  
 
and 24.¦g1 ¥xg2 25.¦xg2 ¦xe4† wins not only one but two pawns: 26.¢f1 ¦xb4 27.¦xd6 
¦xb2µ  Black is much better, although the immobile pawns still give White drawing chances.


698. Efim Geller – Boris Spassky, Moscow 1975
34.¤xd6! 34.¦xg5† £xg5 35.¦g2 is also a combination, but not as strong. Black has drawing 
chances after: 35...£xg2† 36.¢xg2 ¦xa5 37.¤xa5 ¦xa5± After the knight capture, the threat 
against f7 and the pins along the f- and g-files force Black to give up the exchange, but he is 
simply lost after: 34...¦xd6 35.£xa8†+–  (1–0, 39 moves)


699. Boris Spassky – Francisco Sanz Alonso, Montilla 1978
40.¦xg7†! ¢xg7 41.¤e4†  1–0 Black resigned, as forks or discovered attacks are unavoidable, 
for example: 41...¢f7 42.¤e5† ¢e8 43.¤c6+–


700. Anatoly Karpov – Boris Spassky, Montreal 1979
39.¦xe7! White is much better anyway, but this is directly winning. 39...¦xe7 40.d6! £c4 
41.b3!+–  Driving away the counterattack against d3, and ending up plenty of material ahead. 
41.¥xa5 ¦ed7 42.¥xd8 ¦xd8 should also win.


701. Bent Larsen – Boris Spassky, Montreal 1979
22.¦xd5! cxd5 23.¦xc5 ¤xc5 24.¤xd5±  Two rooks are often stronger than a queen and two 
pawns, but they are weak defenders against pawn storms, and White’s plan is to attack on the 
kingside. Larsen won after: 24...¦ea7 25.¥g5 ¦a1† 26.¢h2 ¦8a2 27.£f5 ¤e6 28.¥h4 ¦f1?! 
29.f4 ¦c1 30.£g4 ¦c4? 31.¤f6† ¢h8 32.£h5! 1–0


702. Boris Spassky – Otto Borik, Germany 1982
28.¤xf7! Spassky played 28.£xf7† £xf7 29.¤xf7 when 29...¤xc3!² would have limited the 
material loss to a pawn. 28...£xf7 29.¦d1±  Exchanging on f7 would have helped the black 
king to e6, and forced c3-c4 to win back the piece. And that would have left the b4-pawn en 
prise. The opposite-coloured bishops give Black drawing chances, but fortunately White can keep 
the rooks on in order to make better use of his advantage.


703. Lajos Portisch – Boris Spassky, London 1982
If the queen moves, Black wins back the exchange with ...¥c8 and/or ...¤d2. 23.¥c7!  £a8 
The only try. 24.£h3 24.£d7 is also clearly better. 24...¦e7± 24...¥c8 25.£f3± is no longer a 
problem, since the knight on e4 is semi-pinned.


704. Jan Timman – Boris Spassky, Hilversum (1) 1983
25.¥f5! Black loses an exchange after 25...gxf5 26.£g5† ¦g6 27.hxg6+–  when 28.¤h4 is the 
most efficient follow-up.


705. Jan Timman – Boris Spassky, Hilversum (3) 1983
33...¦c1! 34.£d3 34.£b3 ¥d5–+  only postpones the end and 34.£xe7 ¦xd1†–+  is no 
better. 34...£a3! The threat is to capture the queen. 35.£f1 ¦xd1 Also winning is 35...¥xf3 
36.¦xc1 ¥xg2 37.£xg2 £xa4 with two pieces for a rook. 36.£xd1 ¥c6!–+  White loses the 
knight or the rook.


706. Aldo Haik – Boris Spassky, Paris (3) 1983
25.¦xh6!+– Black can’t take the rook: 25...¢xh6 25...¦h8 26.¦xh8 was the game 
 
(1–0, 44 moves). 26.¦h1† ¢g7 27.£h7† With a mating attack. 27...¢f6 28.f4 The quickest 
way to mate, but it is also possible to mate with only checks: 28.£h6† ¢e5 29.£h2† ¢f6 
30.¤e4† ¢g7 31.£h7 mate


707. Eugenio Torre – Boris Spassky, Bugojno 1984
22...¦c1†! 23.£xc1 £xh2 White can’t save the rook. 24.¦f1 24.g4 is best, but Black is clearly 
better with his extra pawn. 24...£xg3† The rook has to go anyway. 25.¦f2 25.¢d2 £g2†  
26.¢c3 £xf1–+ 25...£g1†–+ 


708. Jonathan Ady – Boris Spassky, London 1984
22...¦xa2! Black wins a second pawn after 23.¦xa2 £b1† 24.¢h2 £xa2  and 25.¥xh6 is not 
enough for White. Black could play either 25...£b1µ (0–1, 37 moves) or 25...gxh6 26.£xh6 
¥f5 27.£f6 ¥e4!µ, stopping ¦h4.


709. Kevin Spraggett – Boris Spassky, Montpellier 1985
35.¦xh7†!  35.£xg2?! £xd4† 36.£b2 ¦c3! and White is not better, for example: 37.¦7f3 
¦xf3! 38.£xd4 ¦xf1†= 35...¢xh7 36.¦f7† 36.£h3† is also mating. 36...¢h6 37.¦f6† The 
fastest mate is: 37.£h4† ¢g6 38.£f6† ¢h5 39.¦h7† ¢g4 40.£h4 mate 37...¢h7 38.£h3† 
¢g7 39.£xg2† ¢h7 40.£g6† 1–0


710. Lajos Portisch – Boris Spassky, Montpellier 1985
29...¦a2! Black is a pawn up but cannot allow 29...£b7? 30.£c4 with a decisive pin. 30.¦xd5 
¦xc2–+  The c-pawn should perhaps be decisive, but Portisch held a draw after 64 moves.


711. Boris Spassky – Lucas Brunner, Solingen 1986
18.¤xh7! ¢xh7 19.£h4† ¢g8 20.¥xe7!±  White should keep the queens on the board, 
partly to attack Black’s king and partly to avoid a light-square blockade (1–0, 36 moves).


712. Boris Spassky – Artur Yusupov, Belfort 1988
39.¦xg7†! ¢xg7 39...¢h8 40.¦h7† postpones the mate by one move. 40.¦f7† ¢h8 41.¤5g6 
mate 


713. Boris Spassky – Jan Timman, Cannes 1990
37...¤f3! A double threat: 38...£xb2 and 38...£h2 mate. 38.£xf3 £xb2µ 


714. Boris Spassky – Artur Yusupov, Linares 1990
18...¤xf3†! 18...¥xf3?? 19.¦xe5! dxe5 20.£xf3+– 19.£xf3 £xe1† An intermediate move with 
check. 20.¦xe1 ¥xf3³  Black has won a pawn, but must keep the rook on the board to have 
reasonable chances of winning the game.


715. Alexander Beliavsky – Boris Spassky, Linares 1990
34.¤f8†! 34.f5 and 34.h5 should also be winning, thanks to the continuing threat of ¤f8†. 
34...¢g8 34...¦xf8 35.£g6† ¢h8 36.£xg7 mate  35.¤d7†!+– White is a rook up after: 
35...£xe8 36.¤xf6† 


716. Boris Spassky – Eric Prie, Montpellier 1991
28.¥xh6! gxh6 Prie made a desperate attempt with 28...¦xc3+–. 29.£g4  Mate follows on g7 
or g8.


717. Robert Fischer – Boris Spassky, Belgrade (9) 1992
19.¤bxc5! 19.¤exc5 does not work: 19...bxc5 20.¦xa6† ¥b6 21.¥xc5 ¥xb3÷ and Black wins 
a piece. 19...bxc5 Spassky played 19...¥c8+– and resigned two moves later. 20.¦xa6† ¢d7 
21.¤xc5†  White wins back the piece with three pawns as interest.


718. Robert Fischer – Boris Spassky, Belgrade (19) 1992
30.¦xe5! 30.¥xe5?! dxe5 31.¦xe5² is too soft – Black has more counterplay with the rooks on 
the board and it’s easier to control a passed d-pawn than an a-pawn. 30...dxe5 31.¥xe5 £e7 
31...£xe5 32.£xa7†+–  and the rook on b6 is lost. 32.d6! Black’s queen has no squares to 
defend the a7-pawn, and after the only move 32...¦xd6 White will emerge with an extra passed 
pawn: 33.¥xd6 £xd6 34.£xa7†±


719. Nana Ioseliani – Boris Spassky, Copenhagen 1997
Black would have had compensation for the exchange if he was allowed to pick up the d-pawn 
for free. 37.d7! Counterattacking with 37.¦a1 is an interesting option. With the knight on h5, 
Black should probably seek safety for his king in the centre with 37...¢f8!±. 37...£d6 37...¤xd7 
38.£e8†  and Black loses the f-pawn, while 37...£xd7 38.¤f6†  forks the queen. 38.¦xc4 
Many other moves were also winning. Black loses one of his pieces due to the pin on the d-file 
after: 38...¤xd7 38...¤xc4 39.£e8†+– and White queens. 39.£d1 1–0


720. Boris Spassky – Viktor Korchnoi, St Petersburg (5) 1999
25...¤xf2! 26.¦f1 26.¤xf2 £e2! (26...¦xf2†?! 27.¢xf2 £d4† 28.¢g2 £xa1 29.¤e4 and White 
has compensation, with firm control over the light squares.) 27.¦f1 ¥h6–+  Black wins back 
the piece with an extra pawn and an attack. 26...£h3† 26...¤xe4 is also a reasonable advantage 
for Black. 27.¢g1 ¤g4!  White’s knights are stepping on each other, and Black uses his solo 
knight for offensive purposes. Black has a clear advantage, but Spassky managed to draw.


721. Boris Spassky – Nicolas Eliet, France 2002
18.f4†! The only winning move. 18.¥e7 traps the king, but there is no mate after 18...¤e8±. 
18...¢xf4 19.¥c7† Spassky’s 19.¦f1† induced resignation, as 19...¢e5 20.¥c7† ¢e6 21.¥c4† 
¢e7 22.¦xf7† ¢e8 23.¥d6 creates the decisive threat of 24.¦e7† followed by 25.¥xg8 (you need 
to see this far if you chose 19.¦f1). 19...¢g5 19...¢e3 20.¥g3 with mate on d3. 20.¦g1† ¢f6 
21.e5† Or White can start with 21.¥d6+– although that gives Black some better options than 
transposing with 21...¢e6. 21...¢e7 22.¥d6† ¢d8 23.¤e4  The knight on g7 drops after 
24.¤f6. And it’s equally good to win the knight with 23.¥d3+–.


722. Boris Spassky – Scott Coleman, Reno (simul) 2004
15.¤xd5! A second and more complicated solution is: 15.exf6 ¦xf6 (15...gxf6 16.¤xe6† ¢f7 
17.£h5† ¢xe6 18.£xd5 mate) 16.£h4 (or 16.£h3) 16...¦f5 17.£h7† You need to see this far. 
17...¢f6 18.g4 ¦xg5 19.fxg5† ¢e5 Black is one move from escaping, but does not get enough 
time: 20.£g6! ¥a6 (defending against ¤b5) 21.¦f7 £e8 22.¦d1!+– White has a crushing attack; 
...¢d6 is not possible right now, and all White’s pieces are homing in on the black king. 15...exd5 
16.f5† ¥xf5 17.£xf5†  ¢h5 18.£h7† 18.¦f3 is also quite strong, with mate in one, and there 
are other ways. 18...¢g4 19.h3† ¢xg5 20.¦f5 mate
At the start, 15.¤xe6† is a good try but doesn’t seem to win straight away. 15...¢f7 Preventing 
White from capturing on f8 with check. 16.exf6 £xe6 (16...£xf6 17.f5+–) 17.£xg7† ¢e8 
18.¦fe1 ¤e4 19.¤xd5! White sacrifices a third piece! 19...£xd5 20.¦ad1 £f5 21.¦d4! The rook 
is immune and White wins back at least a piece and a rook. One line given by the engine is: 
21...¦xf6 22.¦dxe4† ¥e6 23.£g8† ¦f8 24.£xe6† £xe6 25.¦xe6† ¢d7 26.g3±


723. Boris Spassky – Craig Christensen, Reno (simul) 2004
27.¦xf7!  ¤xc3 27...¢xf7 28.£e6† (28.¥xd5† also wins) 28...¢g7 29.¥xd5 Threatening 
mate on f7. After 29...¦f8, White is winning after any move that defends the pawn on f2. One 
efficient way is 30.¥e3 followed by 31.¥d4†. 27...e6!? 28.¦xc7 ¤xc7 and at least one of Black’s 
weak centre pawns will lost, for instance: 29.¥f4 d5 30.¥xc7 £xc7 31.¥xd5+– 28.£e6 1–0 
Mate is coming.


724. Robert Fischer – Heinz Matthai, Montreal 1956
25...¦xc3! The only way to avoid defeat. 26.fxg6!? White has other moves that lead to a draw, 
among them 26.¦h8†, but not 26.£xc3? £xc3 27.bxc3–+ or 26.£h6 £d4, when Black may 
have a tiny plus. 26...¦h3! Also the only move; the threat was 27.¦h8† with mate. 27.£xb4 
¦xh1†=  (½–½, 108 moves)


725. Robert Fischer – Attilio Di Camillo, Washington DC 1956
40.¥c7! Blocking the black rook while unblocking the white one! 40...¤f4† 41.¢f1 1–0 
41.£xf4? £xd7!³ The game move forced resignation due to: 41...¦xc7 42.¦e8†+– 


726. George Kramer – Robert Fischer, New York 1957
19...¤xc3! Totally destroying the seemingly strong dark-square fortification. 20.£xc3 ¤xd4–+  
White has three loose pieces: a1-rook, queen on c3, and c5-bishop. 21.£b4 ¤e2† Stronger is 
21...a5! 22.£a3 ¤b5–+ and Black picks up the rook without having to sacrifice on c5. 22.¢h1 
¦xc5 23.£xc5 ¥xa1 Black is probably still winning, and that was the result nine moves later.


727. Robert Fischer – James Sherwin, New York 1957
30.¦xf7!? The best move. Although it does not lead to a decisive advantage against correct 
defence, it is best both objectively and practically, as Black can easily go wrong. After 30.¥xf7†?! 
¢h8³, Black might take over. 30...¦c1†? Natural but losing. Black had to find: 30...h5! 31.¦c4 
(31.¦f5†?? ¢h7–+ and White is back-rank mated if he takes the queen) 31...¦xc4 32.¦xf8† ¢xf8 
33.£xc4² 31.£f1!! Everything checks out for White. But not 31.¦f1†? ¢h8–+. 31...h5 Three 
alternatives: a) 31...¦xf1† 32.¦xf1† £xd5 33.¦xf8† ¢xf8 34.exd5+–; b) 31...¦xf7 32.¦a8†  
mating; c) 31...¤f2† 32.¦xf2†+–  32.£xc1! £xc1† 33.¦f1† ¢h7 34.¦xc1+– 


728. Robert Fischer – Samuel Reshevsky, New York 1958
9.e5! ¤e8 9...¤h5 10.g4+–  traps the knight and 9...¤xb3 is met by: 10.exf6! ¤xa1 11.fxg7±  
10.¥xf7†! This is now a well-known trick in this line 10...¢xf7 10...¦xf7 11.¤e6+– 11.¤e6!! dxe6 
11...¢xe6 12.£d5†  ¢f5 and Black is mated in several ways. 12.£xd8+–  (1–0, 42 moves)


729. Robert Fischer – Hector Rossetto, Mar del Plata 1959
33.¥b3! Black is in zugzwang. Moving the king or the rook allows 34.¦b8, moving the knight 
allows 34.¥e6. All that remains are a few pawn moves. 33...a5 34.a4 h6 35.h3 g5 36.g4 fxg4 
37.hxg4 1–0


730. Wolfgang Unzicker – Robert Fischer, Varna (ol) 1962
25...¦a2! Going for the b2-pawn and the vulnerable second rank. 26.¢f1 26.¦xa2 £xa2 27.¦e2 
¦xc3!  and 26.¢h1 £f2!  wins (or exchanging on a1 first). 26...¦xc3 With an attack and 
a material advantage, it’s all over. 27.¦xa2 27.bxc3? £f2 mate  27...¦f3† 28.¢e2 ¦f2†  
29.¢d3 £xa2–+ Or 29...£c7–+.


731. Robert Fischer – Victor Ciocaltea, Varna (ol) 1962
15.¥g5! Trapping the queen. 15...hxg5 16.hxg5 £xg5 16...¤f4 is a nice try, but after 
17.gxf6 ¤xe2 18.fxe7+–  the knight is trapped, leaving White a piece up. 17.¤xg5+–  
(1–0, 26 moves)


732. Robert Fischer – L.W. Beach, Poughkeepsie 1963
21.¥h6! Undermining the centralized knight. 21.¤d6†?! ¢d7 (21...¢e7? 22.¥h6+–) 22.¥h6? 
(22.¥f4 ¢xd6 23.¦he1²) This does not work due to: 22...¥xh6 23.£xe5 £c7µ 21...£c7 
 
a) 21...0–0 22.¥xg7 ¢xg7 23.£xe5†–+ ; b) 21...¥xh6 22.¤f6† (22.£xe5 0–0 23.¤f6† ¦xf6 
24.£xb8†+– should also be good enough – full point.) 22...¢f7 23.£xe5+–  With a killing 
attack on the exposed king. 22.¤d6†!  There are options. 22.¤c5+– and 22.¥xg7 £xg7 
23.¤c5+– also give full points. 22...¢d8 22...£xd6 23.¥xg7+– 23.¥xg7 23.¦he1+– 23...£xd6 
23...£xg7 24.£xe5+– 24.£xe5+–


733. Robert Fischer – Arthur Bisguier, New York 1963
29.e6! A full-blown attack with only a few pieces and a couple of pawns! White evacuated 
the e5-square for the bishop. 29...f6+– Also losing is 29...fxe6 30.¥e5! ¤h7 31.fxg6+–  and 
 
29...gxf5 30.exf7†  when White’s attack will win material, for instance: 30...¢g7 31.¥e5† ¥f6 
32.¤e8†+– 30.¤f7! With the bishop coming to d6 and the rook to h8, White is winning but 
other moves were also sufficient (1–0, 36 moves).


734. Robert Fischer – Pal Benko, New York 1963
19.¦f6! Blocking the defensive move ...f7-f5 by drastic means. 19.e5 allows 19...f5!÷. 19...¢g8 
19...h6 20.e5 transposes and there are also other winning moves, while 19...¥xf6 20.e5 £xe5 
21.£xh7 mate  is obviously over. 20.e5!  h6 21.¤e2 With a winning attack. 21.¤e4+– or 
anything else reasonable also wins; Black is quite helpless against White’s attack.


735. Robert Fischer – Kevin Walters, San Francisco (simul) 1964
36.¥c5! Simply winning everything on e7. But not: 36.¦xe7?? ¦xe7 37.¥c5 £f4† (37...£b7–+) 
38.g3 £xf2†!–+ 36...£f4† 36...¥xc5 37.£f7 mate  37.g3 1–0


736. Georgi Tringov – Robert Fischer, Havana 1965
19...£c5† Black has just enough resources to defend, leaving him with a winning material 
advantage. 19...¤f6? 20.£xf8† ¤g8 21.£xg8 mate and 19...¤e7 20.¥xe7+– do not work. 
20.¢h1 ¤f6! 21.¥xf6 The game ended: 21.¥xc8 ¤xe5 22.£e6 ¤eg4 0–1 and 21.exf6 ¥xe6 
22.£xe6 £xg5–+  also loses (or 22...¤d4–+). 21...¥xe6–+ 


737. Robert Fischer – Istvan Bilek, Havana 1965
35.f4! Exploiting the pins to win the central pawns. 35...f5+– 35...exf4 36.£xh5†+–  and 
35...¦xh7 36.f5+–  do not help. After the game move, anything reasonable wins. The game 
concluded: 36.fxe5 ¦xh7 37.£d7† ¦e7 38.£xf5† ¢e8 39.f4 ¢d8 40.e6 1–0


738. Robert Fischer – Svetozar Gligoric, Havana (ol) 1966
18.¤xa6! ¥xh3 Or 18...bxa6 19.¦xc6+–  with a winning attack. For example: 19...£d7 
20.¦xa6† ¢b7 21.¦a7† ¢c8 22.¦a8† ¢b7 23.£a6 mate. 19.e5 Or simply 19.¤c5† ¢b8 
20.¦c3+–. 19...¤xe5 19...fxe5 20.¤c5† ¢b8 21.¦c3!+– 20.dxe5 The game concluded: 20...fxe5 
21.¤c5† ¢b8 22.gxh3 e4 23.¤xe4 £e7 24.¦c3 b5 25.£c2 1–0 Black had had enough.


739. Robert Fischer – Joaquim Durao, Havana (ol) 1966
33.¤xa5! 33.¤f6† ¢e7 34.¤xa5!+– is also good. 33...¦c7 33...bxa5? 34.¤f6† ¢e7 35.¦b7† 
¦d7 36.¦xd7 mate  34.¤c4+–  White wins a second pawn with a decisive advantage since 
34...¦c6 35.a5 bxa5 36.¤f6† again gives mate.


740. Robert Fischer – Renato Naranja, Manila 1967
This exercise is about making a decision, and avoiding a tempting sacrifice. 14.¥g5! Bringing the 
bishop into the attack in the most effective way. Two alternatives: a) 14.g4 looks winning and is 
winning, even though Black gets some counterplay with 14...d5. White chooses between 15.¥a2 
dxe4 16.dxe4 £d4 17.g5 ¥xe4 18.¤e2!+– and 15.g5 g6 16.fxg6 fxg6 17.£g4+– (full points for 
both choices on move 15). b) 14.¥xh6?! gxh6 15.£xh6 ¥g7 16.£g5 ¤c6! The only way to defend 
against 17.f6, but now White’s best is to exchange queens. That’s disappointing, even though 
White still has a strong attack after 17.¤d5! £xg5 18.hxg5±. 14...d5 14...hxg5? 15.hxg5  with 
mate next move. 14...¤c6 defends the bishop but Black’s pawn structure will nevertheless suffer 
after: 15.¥xf6 £xf6 16.¤d5 £d8 17.f6+– 15.¥xf6 dxc4 15...gxf6 16.£xh6 dxc4 17.¦h3+– 
16.£g4+– White is totally dominating and will win enough material (1–0, 32 moves).


741. Robert Fischer – Lhamsuren Myagmarsuren, Sousse 1967
30.£h6! 30.hxg6? fxg6 31.¦xh7 ¦xh7 loses for White, but 30.¥e4!? prevents the defensive move 
...¥d3 and also seems winning for White (full points if you were clear on why it wins). 30...£f8 
31.£xh7†! 1–0 Black resigned due to: 31...¢xh7 32.hxg6† ¢xg6 (32...¢g8 33.¦h8 mate ) 
33.¥e4 mate 


742. Robert Fischer – Oscar Panno, Buenos Aires 1970
29.¤xh7! 29.¤f5! might be even prettier and full points if you saw the following lines: 29...exf5 
30.gxf5 gxf5 (30...f6 31.¥xd5†+–) 31.¥xf5 f6 32.¥e6†! Blocking the e-file. (Not 32.exf6 £e1† 
33.¢g2 £f1†! with a perpetual.) 32...¤xe6 33.exf6 £d7 34.¤xe6+– (or 34.f7†+–) But 29.¥xd5? 
exd5 30.¤f5 gxf5 31.gxf5 which does not work, as 31...¤d6 32.f6 ¤f5 defends and wins. 29...¤xh7 
30.hxg6 fxg6 30...dxe4 31.£xh7† ¢f8 32.£h8 mate  31.¥xg6 Now ¤h5-f6 or ¥xh7 followed 
by £xe6† are on the agenda. 31...¤g5 31...£g7 32.¥xh7† £xh7 33.£xe6†+–  and the knight 
on c8 is en prise, as it also is after 31...¥e8 32.¥xh7† £xh7 33.£xe6†+– . 32.¤h5! White has 
enough attacking pieces to finish Black off, but first some checks must be parried. 32.¢g2+– is 
another way to do that. 32...¤f3† 33.¢g2!+–  33.¢h1? £h4†–+ 33...¤h4† 34.¢g3 ¤xg6 
35.¤f6† ¢f7 36.£h7† 1–0 The end was not far away: 36...¢f8 37.£g8 mate


743. Robert Fischer – Mark Taimanov, Vancouver (2) 1971
82.¥c8! 82.¥f5† ¢f4 83.h4 ¤g4†! is a draw, since the king must keep the bishop protected. 
82.¥e6 ¤f3 and the pawn can’t advance. 82...¢f4 83.h4  ¤f3 83...¤g4† 84.¢g7 and the 
pawn will soon advance. 84.h5 ¤g5 85.¥f5 It is also possible to start with 85.h6. 85...¤f3 
86.h6 ¤g5 87.¢g6 Zugzwang; the pawn promotes. 87...¤f3 88.h7 ¤e5† 89.¢f6 1–0


744. Anatoly Karpov – Viktor Korchnoi, Moscow (2) 1974
24.e5! Cutting off the black queen from the kingside. 24.¤e6? fxe6 25.¤xf6† exf6 26.£xh7† 
leads nowhere: 26...¢f8 27.£h8†? (27.b3! still draws by threatening ¦h6) 27...¢e7 28.¦h7† 
¢d8–+, while 24.¤xf6†? exf6 25.¤h5 (25.£xh7† ¢f8³) runs into 25...£g5†!=. 24...¥xd5 
After 24...dxe5 25.¤xf6† exf6 26.¤h5! there is no queen check on g5 so Black loses: 26...gxh5 
27.¦g1† ¢h8 28.£g7 mate  (or 28.£xf6 mate). 25.exf6 exf6 26.£xh7† ¢f8 27.£h8† 1–0 
Black resigned due to 27...¢e7 28.¤xd5† £xd5 29.¦e1†+– .


745. Viktor Korchnoi – Anatoly Karpov, Moscow (21) 1974
13.¤xh7! ¦e8 13...¢xh7 14.£h6† ¢g8 15.£xg6† ¢h8 16.£h5† (16.£h6† mates in a slower 
way, but White should avoid 16.¥xf7? ¦xf7 17.£xf7 £e8³) 16...¢g8 17.¥e4!  with mate. 
13...¤d4 14.¤xf8+–  (or 14.¥xb7 ¦xb7 15.¤xf8+–) 14.£h6 14.£f4+– is also winning. 
14...¤e5 15.¤g5 Black had to give up the queen to fend off the attack, leaving White with a 
winning position (1–0, 19 moves).


746. Anatoly Karpov – Dirk Suling, Bremen (simul) 1977
38...¤f3†! 39.¦xf3 39.¢h1 ¦h4†–+  wins the queen and 39.gxf3 is met by: 39...£g5† 
 
(or 39...¦g5†) 40.¢h1 ¦h4† 41.£h3 ¦xh3 mate  39...exf3–+ 


747. Anatoly Karpov – Angel Martin Gonzalez, Las Palmas 1977
27.¥xf6! For no material investment, White opens up the black king for a deadly assault. 27.e5 
¤xe5 28.¥xf6+– also works, as does 27.fxg6 hxg6 28.¥xf6+–. 27...exf6 28.¤gxf6† ¥xf6 
29.¤xf6†+–  ¢f8 30.fxg6 Other moves also retain a winning advantage. The game concluded 
with: 30...hxg6 31.£g4! Bringing in the queen to finish the job. 31...¤f7 32.£xg6 ¤ce5 
33.¤h7† 1–0


748. Anatoly Karpov – Viktor Korchnoi, Baguio City (8) 1978
25.¤h6! Setting up a mating pattern on f7. 25...¦g7 26.¦d7! The bishop is tied to the defence, 
and Black cannot protect f7 with any more pieces. 26...¦b8 The alternatives also lose: 26...¥xd7 
27.£xf7† ¦xf7 28.¦xf7 mate  and 26...¦e7 27.¦xe7 (or 27.¦d8† ¦e8 28.£a8 ¥d7 29.¦e1+–) 
27...¢xe7 28.£f6†+– . 27.¤xf7! ¥xd7 28.¤d8†!  1–0 White wins material and gives mate.


749. Anatoly Karpov– John van der Wiel, Amsterdam 1980
29.e8=£†! Not allowing the king to get to relative safety on e8. White needed to avoid 29.£e4? 
£f1†–+ and with the help of some checks, Black manages to trade queens, with a winning 
material advantage. 29...¦bxe8 29...¦hxe8 does not help either: 30.g6† ¢f8 31.£f4† (or 
similarly 31.£f3† or 31.£f2†) 31...¢g8 32.£f7† ¢h8 33.¦xe8† ¦xe8 34.£xe8† ¥f8 35.£xf8 
mate  30.g6† ¢g8 31.¦xe8†  1–0 The attack decides. 


750. Anatoly Karpov – Miguel Quinteros, Buenos Aires 1980
32.f5! The g-file is where the weaknesses are, so White forcefully attacks them. Not 32.¥h5? 
¥d3–+ and Black defends. 32...¦xh7 32...exf5 33.¥xf5+–  (or 33.¥f3+–) 33.fxg6† 33.¦xh7 
exf5 34.¥xf5+– is just as strong. 33...¢g8 33...¢xg6 34.¥xe6† £g5 35.¤f4 mate and 33...¢e8 
34.gxh7+– lose as well. 34.gxh7† ¢h8 35.¤f4! 1–0 The g-file is still the target.


751. Anatoly Karpov – Bent Larsen, Amsterdam 1980
34.d5! Opening up the black king. 34...cxd5 34...exd5 35.£f5†+–  with a winning attack. 
35.c6†! ¢xc6 35...bxc6 36.¦xb8+–  36.£b5† 1–0 White picks up the rook on g1: 36...¢d6 
37.£b6† ¢e7 38.£xg1+– 


752. Zoltan Ribli – Anatoly Karpov, Tilburg 1980
16...¤a5 Exploiting the pin to get at the weak c4-pawn. Black will win this pawn with a serious 
advantage. 17.¤d4 17.¤xe7† £xe7–+  and the pawn is still doomed. 17.£c2 ¤xc4!  
18.£xc4 ¤xd5–+ (or 18...¥xd5–+); 17.bxa5 ¦xb1–+  17...¤xc4–+  (0–1, 25 moves)


753. Anatoly Karpov – Anthony Miles, Amsterdam 1981
32.d5! ¥xd5 32...£f6 33.¦h5!+– and White soon won. Other moves are also good enough. 
32...£c8 and other passive queen moves allow White to attack on the long diagonal. Even 
stronger is starting with 33.h5. 33.£d4+–  A double threat, winning the bishop.


754. Anatoly Karpov – Efim Geller, Moscow 1981
31.¦xf7!+– Queen and knight is the usual combo, but here a queen with a bishop wreaks havoc 
when the king’s defending pawns are gone. The fact that the knight on d5 only protects dark 
squares plays a large part in giving such a free rein to the bishop. Good enough only for a clear 
advantage are 31.£a4 and 31.£c4. 31...¢xf7 32.£xg6† ¢f8 32...¢e7 33.£g7† ¢e8 34.¥g6 
mate  33.£xh6† 1–0 Black resigned due to 33...¢e8 34.¥b5†+–  and 33...¢g8 34.¥h7† 
¢f7 35.¥g6† ¢g8 36.£h7† ¢f8 37.£f7 mate.


755. Anatoly Karpov – Gian Carlo Angioni, Turin (simul) 1982
36.¥d5†! White is much better after retreating the queen, but winning outright is the way to go. 
36...¦xd5 36...¢h8 37.¤f7† ¢g8 38.¤d8† (or 38.¤e5†+–) 38...¦xd5 39.£f7† ¢h8 40.£e8† 
¥f8 41.£xf8 mate  37.£f7† ¢h8 38.£xd5  White is clearly winning and the game ended 
immediately: 38...¦e8 39.¤f7† 1–0 Mate is coming.


756. Anatoly Karpov – De Chen, Hannover 1983
19...¦xf4?! A common sacrifice in the French, but here it would have been better to abstain from 
it. 19...g5! is the only move that’s not clearly worse for Black. White is slightly better after 20.¥xe4 
gxf4  21.¥d3 fxg3 22.fxg3!. 20.gxf4 £xf4 21.¥xe4! dxe4 22.¤e5! Activity brings White a large 
advantage. 22...¤xe5 22...£g5† 23.¢h1± 23.dxe5 ¥d7 24.£xd7 ¦f8 24...£g4† 25.¢f1 £h3†

757. Anatoly Karpov – Murray Chandler, Bath 1983
Black missed a great opportunity for a serious upset against the reigning world champion. 
28...£xh2†! Instead the game went 28...¤xg3? 29.hxg3 £xg3 30.¦xf5+– (1–0, 36 moves). 
29.¢xh2 ¤xg3 29...¥xg3†? 30.¢g1+– 30.£b5 There is no rescue after 30.£a6 ¤e2† , 
mating on the h-file. 30...¤e2†–+  White is forced to give back the queen, leaving Black with 
a winning position. 30...¦h6† 31.¢g1 cxb5 also wins.


758. Garry Kasparov – Anatoly Karpov, Moscow (11) 1985
23.£xd7! ¦xd7 24.¦e8† ¢h7 25.¥e4†  1–0 White picks up a lot of material for the queen, 
gaining a winning material advantage.


759. Garry Kasparov – Anatoly Karpov, Leningrad (16) 1986
35.¦xg6! Threatening mate. 35...£e5 36.¦g8†! 36.£xe5? ¤xe5 37.¦xa6 d2 gives Black serious 
counterplay with the d-pawn. 36...¢e7 37.d6†!  Picking up the queen with a winning attack. 
The game finished: 37...¢e6 37...£xd6 38.¤f5† is mating. 38.¦e8† ¢d5 39.¦xe5† ¤xe5 
40.d7 ¦b8 41.¤xf7 1–0


760. Alexander Beliavsky – Anatoly Karpov, Brussels 1988
37.¤h6! 37.c7? ¦c8 38.¤d4 ¦xc7 39.¦xc7 ¤xc7 40.¤b3 and Black has some drawing chances 
after 40...¥xf2†±. 37...¤d6 No salvation is offered by 37...¢g7 38.¤xf7+–  or 37...¥e7 
38.c7+–. 38.¤xf7! ¤xf7 38...¤xb7 39.¤xd8 ¤xd8 (39...¤d6 40.¤e6†+– ) 40.c7+–  White 
has a new queen on the way. 39.c7  ¦e8 40.¥d7! Winning the most material. 40.¦b8! is also 
good: 40...¦a8 41.¦xa8 ¦xa8 42.¦xc5+– The game continuation of 40.c8=£?! ¦xc8 41.¥xc8 is 
probably winning, but also not totally clear (1–0, 60 moves). 40...¤d6 41.¦b8!+–


761. Anatoly Karpov – Lars Bo Hansen, Thessaloniki (ol) 1988
20.¤xf7! Picking up a pawn. 20.g4 is also quite strong and if you evaluated 20...£e7 21.¤xf7 
as winning, you get full points. 20...£d4 20...¢xf7 21.¦c7† ¢f8 22.¦xb7+–  The check on 
d1 is not dangerous. 21.£d6! Clearly best, but not necessary to see before taking on f7. White 
tries to get the knight out with tempo, and trade off Black’s active queen, but he also attacks the 
weak pawns. 21...£b2 22.¦f1+– 22.¦d1+– is also good enough. Keeping everything protected is 
best tactically here. The game ended in a few moves: 22...¦e8 23.£c7 ¥a8 24.¤g5 h6 25.£f7† 
¢h8 26.e5 1–0


762. Yasser Seirawan – Anatoly Karpov, Rotterdam 1989
30...¥xf3! 30...h4?! 31.¦c8! hxg3† 32.¢xg3= 31.¤xf3 31.£f1–+ is the best defence, but Black 
is winning with an extra pawn and an ongoing attack. After the game move 31.£xa7–+, Black’s 
position is totally winning due to the weak white king (0–1, 42 moves). 31...£xb2†–+  
Winning the rook. But not 31...¦d2†? 32.¢e1±.


763. Jonathan Speelman – Anatoly Karpov, Roquebrune (blitz) 1992
21...¥b5! Using the fact that the queen is bound to the defence of g3. 22.£f3 a) 22.¦f5!? ¥xd3 
23.¦xg5 h2† 24.¢h1 f5!  and ...¥e4† will decide the game. b) Even quicker is 22.£xb5 £xg3† 
23.¢h1 £g2 mate . 22...¥xf1–+ 


764. Alexander Morozevich – Anatoly Karpov, Moscow (rapid) 1992
24...f5! Surprisingly counterattacking the cluster of white pieces in the centre. 25.¥f3 e5! 
26.dxe5 Alternatives are easy to dismiss: 26.hxg6 exf4–+  and 26.¥c1 e4–+ . 26...£xd3–+  
(0–1, 30 moves)


765. Ljubomir Ljubojevic – Anatoly Karpov, Linares 1993
35...¦e1†! 36.¤xe1 Instead, Black gained a winning attack after: 36.¦f1 ¦xf1† 37.¢xf1 
 
£xh2–+  Moves that carry a threat, so that taking on h2 can be played soon, are also winning. 
38.¦d5 ¥xd5 39.cxd5 £xg3 40.fxg5 £f3† 0–1 36...¦xe1† 37.¦f1 £f3!! All-out attack with the 
pieces! 38.¦xe1 £h1† 39.¢f2 £g2† 40.¢e3 £f3 mate 


766. Anatoly Karpov – Judit Polgar, Las Palmas 1994
27.h5! Undermining the knight on f5, which could end up pinned. 27...¤e7 27...gxh5 
 
28.¥e4+–  28.¦ae1  The pressure on e7 and g6 are too much and Black resigned. 28...¦f7 
28...¦ae8 29.hxg6† ¢h8 30.£e4+– 29.hxg6† ¤xg6 30.¦xg6 £xg6 31.¥e4+–


767. Anatoly Karpov – Ivan Morovic Fernandez, Las Palmas 1994
32.¦h8†! White is winning anyway, but this is the fastest way to end the game. 32...¢xh8 
33.£h1† ¢g8 34.¥xf6 £xg3† 34...£xf6 35.£h7† ¢f8 36.£h8 mate  35.fxg3 ¦e2† 36.¢h3 
36.¢f3 ¦2e3† 37.¢g4 ¦xg3† 38.¢h4 and White is still winning, but the game line is a much 
better choice. 36...gxf6 37.¢g4 1–0


768. Anatoly Karpov – Kiril Georgiev, Tilburg 1994
32.¦e8! 32.¤xf7?! £b7 33.¤d8† £d5² 32...£xd6 32...¦xe8 33.£xf7† ¢h8 34.¦xe8†  wins, as 
do 32...c4 33.£xc4 ¤e5 34.¦1xe5  and 32...£b7 33.£xf7† . The last variation could continue 
with 33...¢h8 34.¦xa8 £xa8 35.£xg6 ¤f6 36.¦e7, mating. 33.£xf7† ¢h8 34.¤e6!  1–0 
 
A winning fork. 34.¦xa8 ¦xa8 35.¦e8† ¦xe8 36.£xe8† is also winning due to the fork on f7.


769. Ulf Andersson – Anatoly Karpov, Nykoping (rapid 2) 1995
14.d5! A well-known tactical theme in this type of position, using rook against queen. 14...¤fxd5 
14...¤bxd5 15.¤xd5 (15.¥xd5? ¤xd5µ) 15...¥xd5 16.¥xd5 ¤xd5 17.¥xe7 £xe7 18.¦xd5+– 
15.¤xd5 Or 15.¥xe7, but not 15.¥xd5? ¤xd5 16.¥xe7 ¤xc3µ. 15...¥xg5 16.¤xb4+–  The 
game ended after the further: 16...£e7 17.¤d5 ¥xd5 18.¥xd5 1–0 White is simply a piece up 
for a pawn.


770. Judit Polgar– Anatoly Karpov, Monte Carlo (rapid) 1996
39.¦dxe7!! 39.¦exe7?? ¥xe7 and 39.¤e4?? ¦xd7 40.¤f6† ¢f7 41.¤xd7 ¢xe6 loses for White, 
but 39.¦a7± is good enough for an advantage. 39...¦xe7 39...¥xe7 40.¦xg6† ¢f8 41.¥g7† 
¢g8 42.¥h6† ¢h8 43.¤f7† ¢h7 44.¦g7 mate  40.¦xg6† ¥g7 41.¥xg7 ¦xg7 The game 
ended after 41...¦e2† 42.¢c3+– and two more moves. The king could also have moved to b1. 
42.¦xg7† ¢xg7 43.¤e6†+– 


771. Alexander Onischuk – Anatoly Karpov, Biel 1996
31...¤e4! Threatening a fork on g5 while simultaneously cutting off the rook from the defence 
of the e3-pawn. 31...¥xc5?! allows enough counterplay for a draw: 32.¦e8† ¦xe8 33.£xe8† £g8 
(33...¢g7? 34.£e5† ¢h6 35.£xc5+–) 34.£e5† £g7 35.£e8†= Also equal is: 31...¤b1?! 32.h3. 
32.h4 32.¦e1 ¤g5–+  32...£xe3†–+  33.¢h1 £d4 0–1


772. Anatoly Karpov – Peter Leko, Tilburg 1996
28.¦xh6! 28.£xe7 ¥xh1µ 28...£xh6 29.£e3! 1–0 29.£xe7!?+– doesn’t win a piece, but is still 
good enough. In the game, Black resigned due to 29...£f6 30.£xe4+–  and 29...¤c4† 30.¥xc4 
£h2† 31.¢e1+–  (or 31.¥e2+–).


773. Anatoly Karpov – Marcin Szymanski, Koszalin (simul) 1997
26...¤d3! Pulling the rook to a dangerous square. 26...f4?! 27.g4= 27.¦xd3 f4 A double threat 
against d3 and g3. 28.g4 £xd3 29.gxh5 White has enough material, but the pin on the second 
rank decides. 29...¦e2! 30.£h4 ¦xg2† 30...h6 creates luft and soon wins on g3/f3. 31.¢xg2 
£xf3† 32.¢h2 £g2 mate


774. Valery Salov – Anatoly Karpov, Wijk aan Zee 1998
27.¤c4! Black is too late with his development. The white knight uses the immobility of the 
black queen and knight to head for a5, b6 or d6, whichever has the deadliest effect. 27...¦b8 
Three alternatives: a) 27...£c7 28.£xb7 (or 28.¤d6†+–) 28...£xb7 29.¤d6†+– ; b) 27...£xc4 
28.£xb7+– ; c) 27...0–0 28.¤a5+–  28.¤xb6 0–0 Black also has options here: 28...£xb6 
29.£xb6 ¦xb6 30.¦a8†+–  and 28...¦xb6 29.£a8†+– . 29.¤c4+–  (1–0, 32 moves) 
29.¤a8+– is more convoluted, but should work as well.


775. Vladimir Kramnik – Anatoly Karpov, Frankfurt 1999
20.¥xg7†! 20.¤f5! transposes or wins material straight away. 20...¢xg7 21.¤f5† exf5 22.¦xe7 
¤xe7 23.£e2!+–  The double attack wins a piece.


776. Alexei Shirov – Anatoly Karpov, Monte Carlo (blindfold) 2001
36.£b1†! 36.exf6 is equal, for example 36...¤xf3† 37.¢g2 ¤h4†=, and 36.¦xg7†? ¢xg7 
37.¥xh6† ¢xh6 simply loses for White. 36...¤f5 36...f5 is met by the same theme as in the 
game. 37.¦xg7†! 1–0 Black foresaw 37...¢xg7 38.¥xh6† ¢xh6 39.£xd1+– .


777. Judit Polgar – Anatoly Karpov, Hoogeveen 2003
All White’s pieces are aimed at a very lonely black king. 25.¥xh7†! 25.£h5?! f5± 25...¢xh7 
26.£h5† 1–0 Karpov didn’t want to see 26...¢g8 27.¥xg7! with the classic double-bishop 
sacrifice and a neat finish: 27...¢xg7 (after 27...f5 many moves lead to mate, for instance 
28.£g6+–) 28.¦g3† ¢f6 29.£g5 mate 


778. Andrei Istratescu – Anatoly Karpov Bucharest (3) 2005
31.¥c5! Attacking the defending bishop. 31.¦h8† ¢f7 only gives a clear advantage and 31.¥d4? 
¦e1† 32.¢a2 £xc2–+ is even weaker. 31...¦e7 A desperate attempt to prolong the game, but the 
outcome should not be in question. But it still offers more hope than 31...¥xc5 32.£xg7 mate  
or 31...¦e1† 32.¢a2 £xc2 33.¦h8† ¢f7 34.¦xf8 mate . 32.¥xe7+– (1–0, 74 moves) Other 
moves are winning too.


779. Judit Polgar – Anatoly Karpov, Moscow (blitz) 2009
28...¤xg3† 29.¢g2! 29.fxg3? ¦xe3–+  29...¤ge4–+  Instead, Black let White into the game 
with 29...¦xe3? 30.fxe3 ¤ge4³ and lost in 47 moves. Trading rooks reduces the impact of the 
previously free d-pawn and gives the white pieces more active possibilities.


780. Anatoly Karpov – Arkadij Naiditsch, Kiev (rapid) 2013
24...¤xg3! 24...£b6 25.¦xb4³ 25.fxg3 25.e3–+ basically admitted defeat (0–1, 46 moves). 
25.£xg3 ¦xb5  also loses. 25...£b6† 26.¢f1 £xb5–+ 


781. Anatoly Karpov – Olav Sepp, Puhajarve (rapid) 2013
17.¤xf5! Or 17.¦xg7† ¢xg7 18.¤xf5† transposing. 17...¦xf5 18.¦xg7†! ¢xg7 19.£g4†+–  
White wins back the rook, with an extra piece. 19...¢f6 20.¤e4† Best, but there are other winning 
continuations as well. 20...¢e5 21.¤g3 1–0 Or 21.£g3† ¢xe4 22.£g4† ¢e5 23.£d4 mate.


782. Garry Kasparov – Walter Browne, Banja Luka 1979
38.¥h7†! ¢xh7 38...¢f8 39.£h8 mate  39.£xe6  1–0 White wins f7 with a killing attack. 


783. Garry Kasparov – Leonid Yurtaev, Moscow 1981
29.¦xe6! 29.£h6? £f8µ 29...fxe6 30.£h6+–  1–0 After 30...£f8 simplest is 31.£xg6† ¢h8 
32.£xh5† ¢g8 33.¦g1† mating.


784. Garry Kasparov – Miguel Najdorf, Bugojno 1982
24.¤xg7! 24.£h4?! g6 25.¤e7†± and White only wins an exchange, while 24.¥h6?? even 
loses: 24...¦e1† 25.¥f1 ¥a6–+ Instead 24.¤h6† ¢h8 25.£f5 g6 26.¤xf7†? ¢g7 27.£d7 looks 
clever, but Black has 27...¥c8–+. 24...¥xg7 24...¥c8 25.¤e6† ¢h8 26.£f5 also leads to mate. 
 
25.¥h6  1–0 


785. Matthias Wahls – Garry Kasparov, Hamburg (simul) 1985
27.¥xe5! 27.¦e7†? ¢xd5–+ 27...£xe2 The critical test. The game instead saw 27...£b1† 
28.¢g2+–  when White has a winning attack. Black resigned after 28...¥xe5 29.¤c3. 28.¤f4† 
¢f5 29.¦xf7† ¢g5 30.¤xe2+–  White is simply a piece up.


786. Garry Kasparov – Comp Meph Exclusive S, Hamburg (simul) 1985
17.¤f6†! gxf6 18.exf6 ¢h8 18...¤e7 19.£g5† ¤g6 20.£h6+–  Moving the king is the only 
way to avoid the mate on g7, but Black is mated all the same after: 19.¥e4  1–0


787. Nigel Short – Garry Kasparov, Belfort 1988
24...£b4! 24...¦xb2? 25.¢xb2 e5 26.£xe5 ¥a3† wins the knight on c3, but doesn’t mate on 
b2: 27.¢b1 £xc3 28.¦xd5+– However, 24...¦b4?! is better for Black. Without the second pair 
of rooks, White will not have enough compensation for the exchange. 25.b3 Giving up the b2-
pawn with, for instance, 25.¦1d3 might be a better idea, but Black is much better. And he wins 
after 25.¦xb4? ¥xe3† 26.¢b1 ¦xb4.  25...e5! Overloading the queen. 26.£xe5 £xc3–+ 


788. Ljubomir Ljubojevic – Garry Kasparov, Belfort 1988
38...¥h3! 39.£g1 39.£xh3 £xe1†  is mating. 39...¦e8!  0–1 Winning the bishop, and thus 
the game.


789. Gata Kamsky – Garry Kasparov, New York 1989
36...¦f3! 37.£c1 37.gxf3? gxf3† 38.¢h1 £g2 mate  37...¦xb3  0–1 Black is a piece up, 
and winning.


790. Alexei Shirov – Garry Kasparov, Manila (ol) 1992
35...¥d4!! The white queen is in the crosshairs of the black queen and bishop. The rook cannot 
be taken due to the further pin by the bishop, and the knight cannot take the bishop since the 
queen would drop. And finally a queen trade would allow the intermediate ...¥xf2† winning 
a rook. Instead the game continued 35...£xe3 36.¤xe3 ¥d4 37.¦xd2 ¥xe3† 38.¢h2 ¥xd2 
39.gxf3 ¦g3!µ and Black managed to convert his advantage, although things are far from over. 
36.£xg5 Other moves also lose immediately: 36.£xd4† ¦xd4–+ , 36.¤xd4 £xe3–+  and 
36.£xd2 £xg2 mate . 36...¥xf2†–+ 


791. Nigel Short – Garry Kasparov, London (rapid 2) 1993
36...e4! 37.£xe4 37.¦xe4 £xc3  and the back-rank mate decides. 37...¦xc3 38.£xb4 Instead 
White resigned after 38.¦d4 £d6 39.f6 ¥xf6 since 40.£e8† does not mate. 38...¥xb4–+ 


792. Garry Kasparov – Krystian Klimczok, Katowice (simul) 1993
17.f6! gxf6 17...¥xe3 18.£xe3+–  Black cannot resist the white attack since he has no defenders 
against so many attackers. 18.¥xg5! 18.exf6?! ¥xf6 19.¥xh6 ¥xd4! is rather unclear. 18...fxg5 
19.¦f6!  The weak f6-square is Black’s downfall. There are several ways to win from here by 
playing stuff like ¦af1 and ¦xh6, as in the game, or simply opening up the kingside with h4. 
19...¢g7 20.¦af1 White threatens, among others, 21.¦xh6 ¢xh6 22.¦f6† £xf6 23.exf6 ¦g8 
24.£e3 followed by ¥d3 and £h3. 20...¤e7 21.h4 1–0 Black cannot resist the attack. 


793. Garry Kasparov – Vassily Ivanchuk, Linares 1994
30.¦e8! Threatening mate on a7. The idea is to force Black’s queen to h2, so he can’t take on b6 
in case of a5-a6. 30.¢f1 gives a clear advantage and 30.¦e5 £c6 31.¥f3+– is a complicated win 
– due to zugzwang! 30...£h2† 30...¦xe8 31.£xh6+–  31.¢f1 ¦xe8 31...£xg2† 32.¢xg2 d4† 
33.£xb7†! (33.f3 ¦xe8 34.a6 also wins, as does 33.¦e4 ¥xe4† 34.f3 and 33.¢f1 ¦xe8 34.a6.) 
33...¦xb7 34.¦xh8+– 32.a6  1–0 White’s point, mating.


794. Viswanathan Anand – Garry Kasparov, New York (11) 1995
30...¦xb4† 31.¢a3 31.¢c1µ After the game move, the rook looks trapped, but Kasparov had seen 
further. 31...¦xc2! 0–1 Anand resigned due to: 32.¦xc2 ¦b3† 33.¢a2 ¦e3† 34.¢b2 ¦xe1–+ 


795. Garry Kasparov – Yasser Seirawan, Amsterdam 1996
31.¤h5! 31.¦g8 prepares to send the knight to g6, but Black has 31...¦6a7! when best is: 
32.¤h5 £xg8 33.¤f6† ¢f7 34.¤xg8 ¢xg8= 31...£c7 31...£xh5? 32.£e7 mate  32.¦g7 Or

35.¤f6† ¢d8 36.£xf8 mate.


796. Garry Kasparov – Viswanathan Anand, Moscow (rapid) 1996
32.¥d8!+–  Turning the coming ¤e7† into a deadly threat. The immediate 32.¤e7†? is met by 
32...¦xe7 33.fxe7 £xe7µ. 32...¤e6 32...¦xd8 33.¤e7†+– 33.¤e7† ¦xe7 34.fxe7 £d7 35.¦h3 
1–0


797. Garry Kasparov – Zbynek Hracek, Yerevan (ol) 1996

20.c4! ¥c6 21.¦xd7! ¥xd7 22.¤xf6† ¢g7 23.¤xd7+–  Black resigned three moves later.


799. Garry Kasparov – Vladimir Kramnik, Moscow (blitz 1) 1998
39.d5! Kasparov played 39.¦xf5† ¥xf5 40.¤f7† ¢f4 41.¤xd8= and Black held a draw after 
41...¢e4 42.¤xc6 ¤e6. A critical, but not forced, variation is 43.¤c8 ¤xd4 44.¤d6† ¢d5 
45.¤xd4 ¢xd4 46.¤xf5† ¢xc5 when White can’t keep the last pawn. 39...cxd5 40.¤b7 ¦e8 
41.c6  The c-pawn and the pin on the e-file win a piece, and thus the game. For example, 
41...¢f6 42.¦e1 ¦e7 43.¤c5 followed by ¤xe6 and ¤xd5.


800. Garry Kasparov – Vladimir Kramnik Moscow (blitz 18) 1998
33.¤f4! ¥d7 33...¥f7 34.¦xg8 ¦xg8 35.¦h1+– also wins the f-pawn and 33...¦xg5 34.¦xe6†+–  
picks up two pieces for a rook. 34.¦h5! ¤g4 35.¥xf5 ¤f6 36.¦h6!+– A last finesse, leaving 
White with two healthy extra pawns. 


801. Vladimir Kramnik – Garry Kasparov, Moscow (blitz 19) 1998
38.f5! The only way to keep material on the board. 38...¥xe5 39.£b7! Keeping the g-pawn. 
39.£xa7?! exf5 and Black will be able to reach an ending with rook and f-pawn versus queen. 
39...¦d6 40.fxe6 ¦xe6 41.£xa7 Black has to give up the bishop for the a-pawn. With the help of 
zugzwang, White is probably able to win the g-pawn. But it doesn’t matter – it’s a fortress anyway. 
If Black’s king stays on g7, White can never sacrifice the queen to get a winning pawn ending. The 
same ending is reached after: 38...¦xe5 39.£e7! (39.£d8? is a double threat against d4 and g5, but 
39...¦e3† 40.¢g2 ¥f6= defends) 39...¦e3† 40.¢g2 ¥f6 41.£xa7 ¦e4 42.fxe6 ¦xe6
So 38.f5 is only a draw, but it’s a good try that was rewarded in this blitz game: 38...exf5 39.e6 
1–0 The exercise is about decision-making. Calculating all the variations above is not necessary 
before playing the first move.


802. Garry Kasparov – Vladimir Kramnik, Frankfurt 1999
35.¦xd5! exd5 35...£xf4 36.¤xf4 ¦xd5 37.¤xd5+–  36.¤d4† Black resigned, since he is 
mated after: 36...¢d8 37.¤e6†! fxe6 38.£xf8 mate 


803. Garry Kasparov – Jan Timman, Wijk aan Zee 2000
35.¢xd5 35.g4† is not a good move order: 35...¢e5 36.b6 d2 37.b7 d1=£ 38.b8=£† ¢e4= 
When there is no mate. 35...d2 36.g4†! 1–0 The rook stops the pawn after: 36...¢xg4 37.¦c4† 
¢f5 38.¦d4+– 


804. Thien Hai Dao – Garry Kasparov, Batumi (rapid) 2001
23...¦xe3†!! 24.£xe3 24.¢xe3 ¦e8† 25.¢f4 g5† 26.¢f5 £xf3 mate  24...£xg4† 25.¢f1 
£xd7–+  Black has won two pawns.


805. Garry Kasparov– Ruslan Ponomariov, Linares 2002
38.¦xe6† 1–0 It’s over: 38...¢xe6 (38...£xe6 39.£g7† £f7 40.£xf7 mate ) 39.¦d6† ¢xd6 
40.£xf6†+– 


806. Alexander Huzman – Garry Kasparov, Rethymnon 2003
21.¦xd5! £e8 No better are 21...£xd5 22.¤e7†+–  or 21...¤xd5 22.£xg7 mate . 22.¥xc4 
1–0 Any other reasonable 22nd move also wins.


807. Alexander Khalifman – Jaan Ehlvest, Lvov 1985
30.¥f5! But not 30.¦xd4? £xc2 mate. White should first defend by blocking and deflecting the 
bishop. 30...¥xf5 31.£c7!! Then an X-ray defence, deflecting the queen and threatening the 
knight! 31...¦xd1† 32.¢xd1+–  Black loses a piece (1–0, 42 moves).


808. Yuri Balashov – Alexander Khalifman, Minsk 1985
39.¤hxf6! Deflecting the defence of d6, winning two pawns. White would be better anyway, but 
this is the win. 39...¤xf6 40.¤xd6† ¢f8 41.¤xb7+–  (1–0, 49 moves)


809. Alexander Khalifman – Vladimir Dimitrov, Groningen 1985
33.b4! 33.¥xd5 ¥xb5 34.axb5 is nothing. 33...¥xb5 34.bxc5 ¥xa4 A better defence is 34...¥e2 
35.¦e1 (or 35.¦d2) 35...bxc5 36.¦xe2  d4± which is not as clear, but still very promising for 
White. 35.¦a1 Or 35.¦d4. 35...bxc5 36.¦xa4  White should win, and did so after 49 moves.


810. Alexander Khalifman – Adrian Mikhalchishin, Kuibyshev 1986
26.¤xf6! Clearing the h-file. 26...¤xf5 26...¦xf6 27.¦xh7† ¢xh7 28.£h4 mate  (or 28.£h3 
mate) 27.¦xh7†  Or 27.¤xh7 ¢g7+–, as in the game. Instead, 27.¤xg8? ¢xg8 28.exf5 ¦xf5± 
gives Black hope. 27...£xh7 28.¤xh7 ¢xh7 29.exf5+–


811. Alexander Khalifman – Alexander Huzman, Tashkent 1987
Black is threatening to protect himself with ...¦g8 and start some counterplay with ...¥c5, so 
White must be quick with his attack. 28.¦g4! The slightly odd 28.b4 also wins quickly since after 
28...¦g8 29.£xf7 the counterattack with ...¥c5 is prevented (full points). 28...¥c5 28...¦g8 
29.¦fg3 ¦xg4 (29...¥c5 30.£xh7† ¢xh7 31.¦h4 mate ) 30.£xg4  and mates. 29.£xh7†  
1–0 Mating in two moves. 


812. Alexander Khalifman – Mikhail Ulibin, Sochi 1989
17.¤xe6! Removing all the defenders against £d5†, picking up the unprotected rook on a8. 
17...£xe6 18.¦e1! £xe1† 18...£f7 19.¦e7 £g6 20.£d5†+–  19.£xe1+–  (1–0, 24 moves)


813. Alexander Khalifman – Ventzislav Inkiov, Moscow 1989
23.b4! ¥a7 24.¦xd6! £xd6 Instead the game continued 24...¦ad8 25.¦fd1 and White won. 
25.£xf6† ¦g7 26.¥xg7† ¤xg7 27.£xd6+– 


814. Ljubomir Ljubojevic – Alexander Khalifman, Reykjavik 1991
31...£f3 Since everything else loses the knight, the winning idea is not so hard to spot here, but 
it could easily be missed when calculating this line earlier in the game. 32.£xd3 ¦xf2! 33.¥xf2 
£xd3–+  (0–1, 40 moves)


815. Alexander Khalifman – Bent Larsen, London 1991
29.¤e7†! Starting a merry hunt for loose black pieces. 29...¢f7 29...¢h5 avoids the capture on 
d7 coming with check, but the king is too exposed; White wins with 30.¤e4 or 30.h3. 30.¤c6! 
Forcing away the defender is better than 30.¤e4±. 30...¦c8 31.¦xd7† ¢e8  A counter-trick! 
32.¤xe5! Moving one threatened piece to defend the other by overloading the bishop. 32.¦c7? 
¤xc7 33.dxc7 ¦xc7 is not better for White, but 32.¦xh7?! ¦xc6± has won a pawn compared to 
the starting position. 32...¥xe5 33.¦e7† ¢d8 After 33...¢f8 White has a number of ways to 
win, for instance: 34.¥h6† ¢g8 35.¦xe6 ¥xc3 36.d7+– 34.¥b6† 1–0 Black loses several pieces.


816. Alexander Khalifman – Ivan Sokolov, Wijk aan Zee 1991
32.¦xg6†!+– 32.¦gh3? ¥g7! 33.fxg7? (33.¦xc4 ¥f8 34.¦ch4 ¥g7=) 33...¦xe5–+ 32...fxg6 
33.¦xh8†! 33.f7†? ¢xf7 34.¥xh8± is not over yet. Black can try 34...¦xh8!? 35.¦xh8 ¦xc3. 
33...¢f7 33...¢xh8 34.f7† ¦xe5 35.f8=£†+–  34.¦h7†  The bishops and the dangerous 
f-pawn decide the game. Black resigned in a few moves. 34.¦xe8+– also gets the job done.


817. Alexander Khalifman– Yasser Seirawan, Wijk aan Zee 1991
22.¤h6†! gxh6 22...¢h8 23.£xf7! (23.¤xf7†? ¢g8 24.¤h6†? gxh6–+) 23...gxh6 (if 23...¥d6 
then 24.£g8†! is not the only move, but it’s not acceptable to overlook such a chance... 24...¦xg8 
25.¤f7 mate ) 24.¥xf6† ¥g7 25.£xg7 mate  23.£g4† 1–0 Black resigned in view of 23...¥g7 
24.¥xf6  mating.


818. Alexander Khalifman – Soenke Maus, Hamburg 1991
25.¤h5! 25.¦xd3 ¤xd3 26.¤h5 is a worse move order since it allows: 26...¥xd4 27.£xd4 gxh5 
28.£xd3 ¦xe7= 25...¥xd4 25...gxh5 26.¦xd3! (26.¤b3 and 26.£g5† is probably also winning, 
but less clear) 26...¤xd3 27.£g5† ¢h8 28.¥f6 mate  26.£xd4 gxh5 27.£xc5+–  The passed 
pawn and dark-square domination provide a decisive advantage (1–0, 34 moves).


819. Gerald Hertneck – Alexander Khalifman, Germany 1992
19...¤xg2! 19...¥xh3? 20.gxh3 £g5† 21.£g4+– 20.¢xg2 ¥xh3† 21.¢g3 21.¢g1 £g5† 
22.¢h2 £g2 mate  21...¦e6 Threatening 22...£g5† 23.¢xh3 ¦h6† mating. Black’s attack is 
winning (0–1, 56 moves). Opening the files will soon decide the game after: 22.f4 g5–+


820. Dmitry Gurevich – Alexander Khalifman, Moscow (rapid) 1992
26...£b7? Easily winning, right? 27.c6! Don’t underestimate a passed pawn! 27...£xb2 28.£xb2 
Or 28.¦d8† ¤xd8 29.£xb2. 28...¦xb2 29.¦d8†! A standard motif with a pawn on the sixth 
rank versus a knight. 29...¤xd8 29...¢h7 30.¦xa8+– 30.c7+– Both promotion squares cannot 
be protected. 30...¦b1† 31.¤f1 ¦d1 32.c8=£ ¥b7 33.£c2 ¦d5 34.¤xg6 1–0 So Black should 
have avoided the tempting mating threat. Stronger was 26...¤xd4= .


821. Alexander Khalifman – Oswald Gschnitzer, Germany 1993
37.¤h5! Some other moves also win, but the winning idea is still this move. 37...gxh5 38.£h6  
Preparing 39.¤f6 mate. 38.¦g3† ¥g4 39.£h6 also works. 38...f6 39.£g6† ¢h8 40.¤xf6 1–0 
Black is mated, as he also would be after other moves.


822. Alexander Khalifman – Grigory Serper, St Petersburg 1994
27.¥xd7! 27.¤xe5 £xe5² counterattacking the b2-rook. There is no way to win after 27.d6 
cxd6. 27...¤xd7 27...¦xd7 can be met by, among others, 28.¤xe5 28...£xe5 29.£xd7+–  
and if Black tries to save the knight with the lifeline 27...£xd7, White threatens b7 and then 
picks up the knight on e5. It can be done in three ways: 28.¦cb5+– , 28.£b4+– or 28.£b3+–. 
28.¦xb7†! 28.¦xc7!? ¢xc7 29.£xa7 ¦b8 30.d6† also wins after 30...¦xd6 31.¦xb7† ¦xb7 
32.£xb7† ¢xb7 33.¤xd6† ¢c6 34.¤xe8. But 28.¦cb5?! ¤b6 is only an advantage. 28...¢xb7 
29.¦xc7†! ¢xc7 30.£xa7† ¢c8 31.d6  1–0 Mating next move.


823. Dirk Fehmer – Alexander Khalifman, Eupen 1994
17...¥h3! The fork on f3 decides. 18.£c2 18.gxh3 ¤f3†–+ ; 18.¤f4 ¥xg2! 19.¤xg2 ¤f3†–+  
18...¥xg2–+  (0–1, 27 moves)


824. Alexander Khalifman – Norbert Sehner, Germany 1994
Several lines might win slowly, but the easiest is 39.¤f5†! ¢g6 40.¦xg7†!+–  and the fork on 
e7 leaves White two pawns up in an endgame.


825. Alexander Khalifman – Valerij Filippov, Kazan 1995
18.¤e4!  18.¤g4 £d8 19.£c3± 18...fxe4 18...£d8 19.¤g5†! with a winning attack 
 
(or various other moves with a winning position anyway). 19.fxe4 ¤f4 20.gxf4 Or first 20.¥d6+–. 
 
20...¦hd8 21.¥d6+– White is dominating and won the game. Weaker is 21.fxe5?! ¦xd2±.


826. Alexander Khalifman – Evgeny Bareev, Moscow 1995
16.c6! The fork on e7 wins a piece or allows the pawn to queen. 16...£a7 16...¤xc6 runs into: 
17.£xc6! £xc6 (17...¥xd5 18.exd5+–  or 18.£xd5+–) 18.¤xe7† ¢h8 19.¤xc6+–  17.c7! 
¥xd5 17...¤d7 18.¤xe7† ¢h8 19.c8=£+–  18.c8=£+–  (1–0, 36 moves)


827. Helmut Pfleger, – Alexander Khalifman Germany 1996
36.c6! bxc6 36...¥xb4 37.cxd7!+–  (also winning is 37.£xb4 ¦xc6 38.¥xc6+–) 37.¥xf8 ¦xf8 
38.¥xc6 £d8 39.¥xa8+–  (1–0, 42 moves)


828. Valery Loginov – Alexander Khalifman, St Petersburg 1996
Black has a great position, but there is only one crushing continuation. 31...¥a2! 32.0–0 
32.¦xa2 ¦xb1†–+  32...¥d5 Or the computer preference 32...£xh3–+ or something else. 
33.¥g6 £g5† 0–1


829. Alexander Khalifman – Thomas Casper, Germany 1997
36.¤xd6! £f4† White delivers mate after 36...¤xd6 37.£xg7 mate  and 36...£d4 37.¤xe8 
¦xe8 38.£xg7 mate . 37.£xf4 exf4+– White has a dominating endgame (1–0, 48 moves).


830. Alexander Khalifman – Alexander Fishbein, New York 1998
23.¦xd2! ¦xd2 24.¤h6† 1–0 Black resigned due to 24...¢h8 25.¦f7 ¦d7 26.¥g7 mate .


831. Michael Unger – Alexander Khalifman, Bad Wiessee 1998
30...¥xf2†! 31.¢g2 31.¢h1 £f1 mate and 31.¦xf2 £xe4 wins the queen. 31...¥e3†!  Black 
takes the bishop on the next move (0–1, 44 moves). But 31...£xe4† 32.¦xe4 ¥c5µ is not over 
yet.


832. Alexander Huzman – Alexander Khalifman, Bugojno 1999
30.f5! Opening an additional file for the decisive breakthrough. 30...exf5 31.¦g1! ¤f4 31...¦g8 
32.¥xg6† ¦xg6 33.¦e7†+–  was the point of opening the e-file before playing ¦g1. 31...¦xe3 
32.¥xg6†  wins for White. 32.¥xe8+–  With such a useless bishop as the one on d7, Black 
really cannot claim compensation (1–0, 72 moves).


833. Alexander Khalifman – Peter Acs, Hoogeveen 2002
30...¦xg2†! 30...axb6 31.¤b5! and the queen can’t keep the pin on the f-pawn while defending 
the knight on d2. However, Black is clearly better after 31...£g4 32.£xg4 ¦xg4 but unlike 
the game, White can fight on. And if 30...¤f3†? 31.¢f1 ¦xg2 he has an equal position after 
32.£xf3! ¦xf3 33.¦xd4. 31.¢xg2 £g7†! 32.¢h2 32.¢h1 ¦h3 mate  32...¤f3† 33.£xf3 
33.¢h1 £g4!  mating. 33...¦xf3–+  White resigned in two more moves.


834. Alexander Khalifman – Gabriel Sargissian, Internet 2004
40.¦xc5! 40.¤c7?? £xc7 41.¦xc5 £xc5 42.£xf7† ¢h6–+ 40...£xc5 41.£f6† ¢g8 41...¢h6 
42.¦e4+–  (or 42.¤e3+–) 42.¤e3!+–  Black cannot defend against the onslaught without 
taking heavy casualties. 42.¤f4!+– is even cleaner, and 42.¤b6 wins as well, even though it sends 
the knight in the wrong direction. Instead the game went 42.¤e7†?? ¦xe7 43.£xg6† when 
White had nothing better than a perpetual, since the rook on d8 defends against rook lifts.


835. Alexander Khalifman – Ernesto Inarkiev, Khanty-Mansiysk (3) 2005
33...¤xd5! White collapses on the light squares, incurring heavy material losses. 33...¦xf3 
34.¢xf3 ¤xd5† 35.¢e2 £xe6 36.exd5µ is also a good try, but not clearly winning. 34.¦f2 
34.exd5 £xf3†–+  34...¥xc6 Not the easiest win. 34...¤df4†–+ is one good move, 34...¤e3† 
another. 35.£xh6 35.exd5 requires Black to find: 35...¦xf3! 36.dxc6 (36.¦xf3 £xf3† [or 
36...¥xd5–+] 37.¢xf3 ¥xd5† 38.¢g4 ¥xh1–+) 36...¦xf2†! 37.¥xf2 £xe6 This is winning, since 
38.£xh6? runs into 38...¤f4†–+. 35...£xe6?! Now Black starts to drift. Better is 35...¤e3† 
36.¢h2 £xe6 winning. 36.exd5 ¥xd5 37.¥xd5 £xd5† 38.¢h2 Black should still win, but 
there are difficulties, and in the game he did not play accurately enough (½–½, 62 moves).


836. Valerij Popov – Alexander Khalifman, Aix les Bains 2011
19...¤eg4†! 19...¤fg4† 20.¢g1 ¤xe3 21.fxe3µ is less convincing, as here the knight would be 
better on f6 because of the control over e4 and pressure on e3. 20.hxg4 20.¢g1 ¤xe3 21.fxe3  
The e3-pawn can be taken at will, so Black is much better. 20...¤xg4† 21.¢g1 ¥xg2 22.¢xg2 
¦xe3!µ  The rook cannot be taken, so Black has won a pawn for no compensation. White 
collapsed quickly: 23.¤f4 ¦d8 24.¦h1 ¦e4 25.¦c1 ¤xf2 0–1 Another tactic against the white 
king and queen finished the game. 26.¢xf2 is met by 26...¦xd4 27.£xd4 ¥b6 winning the 
queen. 


837. Alexander Khalifman – Ilya Duzhakov, St Petersburg 2012
24.e4! Driving away the defender of the bishop on d6. 24.g4? hxg4 25.hxg4 ¥xd5 26.¦xd5 
¤h4 is not winning – White needs e4-e5. 24...¤g7 24...¥xc5 25.exf5+– wins a piece, which 
is preferable to 25.bxc5 ¤g7 26.¤f6†+– winning the queen. 25.¤xe7†! ¥xe7 25...£xe7 
26.¥xd6+–  26.¦xd8+–  (1–0, 29 moves)


838. Alexander Khalifman – Konstantin Kostin, Voronezh 2014
29...f2! Clearing the way for the queen to do serious damage. 29...£xg5 30.¥f2 is equal. 30.¥xf2 
£xf2 31.¦xh1 £f3† 32.¢c2 £xh1µ  Black has a healthy pawn extra, and won after 41 moves.


839. Alexander Khalifman – Sergey Grishchenko, Sochi 2014
20.¤xc6! There are three tempting options that don’t work: a) 20.¤e6?? ¤xe6–+; b) 20.¤f5?? 
¤xf5–+; c) 20.£xg7†? ¢xg7 21.¤f5† ¢g8 22.¤xh6 mate is nice, but the opponent is seldom so 
helpful. 21...¢g6 22.¤xe7† is also good for White, but 21...¢f7 22.¤xd6† ¢e6 leaves Black a 
piece up. 20...£xg4 20...¦f7± and White has won an important pawn. 21.¤xe7† ¢f7 22.hxg4 
¢xe7 Instead Black tried 22...¤d3 but his position was hopeless after 23.¤f5 (1–0, 26 moves). 
23.¥xg7  With so many extra pawns, White is winning.


840. Veselin Topalov – Vladimir Kramnik, Belgrade 1995
38...¥c3†! There is no follow-up after 38...a5†? 39.¢xb5+–. 39.£xc3 a5† The king can no 
longer protect the queen. 40.¢xb5 £xc3  0–1


841. Jeroen Piket – Vladimir Kramnik, Monte Carlo (rapid) 1999
29.£h6! £g8 30.f4! ¥xb2 31.e5! Cutting off the defence. 31...£g6 32.£f8† £g8 33.£e7 
Or 33.£d6. 33...£g6 34.£d8† 1–0 Black resigned due to 34...£g8 35.£xf6† £g7 
 
36.£xg7 mate .


842. Vladimir Kramnik – Ljubomir Ljubojevic, Monaco (rapid) 2000
30.¥xf6 ¥xf6 31.¦e7†! Sacrificing an exchange to win on the dark squares. 31...¢h6 31...¥xe7 
32.¦xe7† ¢h6 33.£d4 ¦g8 34.£f6  delivers mate, while the d-pawn decides after 31...¢g8 
32.¦c7  (32.d7 is also winning). 32.¦f7! Still going for the dark squares. 32...¥h4 33.£d4!  
¦g8 34.£a7 Strongest, but by now other moves also win. 34...¦h8 35.¦ee7 White is mating. 
35...g5 36.¦f6† ¥g6 37.¦xg6† ¢xg6 38.¦e6† ¢f5 39.£f7 mate


843. Peter Leko – Vladimir Kramnik, Budapest (4) 2001
22...¥b4! Bad are 22...gxf6 23.¦de2± and 22...¥xd5 23.¦xd5+–. 23.f7 23.¤xb4 ¦xd2 24.¤xd2 
¦xe1†–+  23...¦xe4! 23...¥xd2 24.fxe8=£ ¦xe8 25.¦e2± 24.¦xe4 ¥xd2 25.¦e7! A nice last 
trick, but it doesn’t save the position. 25...¥xd5 26.¦e8 ¥xf7 27.¦xd8µ  The bishop pair is 
usually much stronger than a rook and pawn.


844. Vladimir Kramnik – Darmen Sadvakasov, Astana 2001
19.¤xf7! 19.¥xe5 ¤xe5 20.¤xh7 ¥xh7 21.£xe5 £xe5 22.¦xe5± only wins a pawn. 19...¦xf7 
20.£xf5! ¦xf5 The game ended after 20...g6 21.¥xe5. 20...¥xb2 21.¦d7!  is also all over. 
21.¦d8 mate 


845. Vladimir Kramnik – Sergey Volkov, Moscow 2005
38.d5! Opening the diagonal for a winning discovered attack on the queen. 38...exd5 38...¦b7 
39.d6 is plainly winning for White. 39.¦cxd5 £xe3 40.¦xd8†  ¢g7 41.£d3 1–0


846. Vladimir Kramnik – Lazaro Bruzon, Turin (ol) 2006
26.¥xf7†! ¢xf7 27.£a2† ¢f8 27...¢e7 28.¤f5† ¢f8 29.¥d6†+–; 27...¢f6 can only be refuted 
in one way: 28.¥d8†! ¦xd8 29.£e6† ¢g5 30.¤f3† ¢f4 And now there are several ways to mate 
in three moves. 28.¤e6†  Also strong is preparing ¥d6† with 28.¤f5+–. 28...¦xe6 29.£xe6 
¤e7 29...£g5 30.¦xd7 ¥xd7 31.¥d6†! ¤e7 32.£xd7+– 30.¦e3!+– White is clearly winning 
and the game ended quickly: 30...¢e8 31.¦f3 £h5 32.¥d6 1–0


847. Veselin Topalov – Vladimir Kramnik, Elista (3) 2006
38.¥xf5! 38.e7 ¦b8= 38...¦xd1 38...¦xf5 39.¦xd6  ¦xd6+– and the check on f2 isn’t dangerous 
after 40.£xg4 or 40.¦d3. 39.¥g6† ¢f8 40.e7† £xe7 41.¥xe7† ¥xe7 42.¥d3!+–  This is the 
only winning move, preventing the black counterplay connected with ...¦d2†, while keeping a 
rook that it is needed in the attack (1–0, 45 moves).


848. Vladimir Kramnik – Magnus Carlsen, Monte Carlo (rapid) 2007
22.¦c6! Somewhat weaker is: 22.£h7 ¢e7 23.¦c6! ¦xc6 (23...¤d7 24.£h4†!+–) 24.£xg8 ¦c8 
25.£h8+– and 22.¦aa6 ¢e7 (22...¤xa6? 23.¦xe6†+–) 23.¦ac6 ¦xc6 24.¦xc6 £xb5 25.¦xc5+–. 
22...¦xc6 Instead the game ended after 22...¤d3 23.¦xc8† £xc8 24.¦xa7 1–0 23.bxc6 £xc6 
24.£h8 Black doesn’t have a second rook on the back rank any more. Also 24.£h7+– is good 
enough. 24...¦xh8 25.gxh8=£†+– 


849. Boris Gelfand – Vladimir Kramnik, Moscow 2008
32...¤ce3? A tempting but bad try that Kramnik fell for. 32...£f8µ  is best, but anything other 
than the main line that does not seem bad gives full points. Two more alternatives are 32...¥xf2† 
33.£xf2 ¦xc6 34.¥xc6 £xc6³ and 32...¤fd6³. 33.fxe3 ¤xe3 34.¥d4! 34.¦d2 ¤d5† 35.¢h1 
£xc6 with a winning position, was Black’s idea. 34...¥xd4 35.¦xd4 35.¤xd4? ¤xd1 36.£xd1 is 
winning for Black due to the two pawns and White’s unstable knight. ¤xg2 36.¤b4!= The knight 
on g2 is trapped, so Black will have to show some care to draw this with some pawns for a knight.


850. Vladimir Kramnik – Peter Svidler, Moscow (blitz) 2008
24...¤f2! Black’s tactical threat is 25...dxe4, but the knight might also just continue to d3. Not 
24...dxe4? 25.£xc4†±. 25.¥e3!? A smart try, but not good enough. 25...¤d3!  Black threatens 
the rook but also 25...¥a6 followed by 26...dxe4. White’s knight can’t move due to a discovered 
attack. Worse is: 25...¥xe3?! 26.¦xe3 ¤d3 27.¦xd3 ¥xd3 28.£xd3 dxe4 29.¥xe4µ 26.¦e2 ¤b4 
0–1


851. Vladimir Kramnik – Viswanathan Anand, Bonn (5) 2008
29.¤xd4?? Take a full point for any non-blundering move, but best seems either 29.¤d2÷ or 
29.¥xd7÷. 29...£xd4 30.¦d1 ¤f6! 31.¦xd4 ¤xg4 32.¦d7† ¢f6 33.¦xb7 ¦c1† 34.¥f1 
Maybe White had seen this far and counted on his queenside pawns to decide the game, but it 
was already time to resign two moves later: 34...¤e3! 35.fxe3 fxe3 0–1


852. Arkadij Naiditsch – Vladimir Kramnik, Dortmund 2009
22...¥xg2! 22...£g4? 23.¤g3= 23.¤g3 23.¢xg2 £h3†  is mating. For example: 24.¢g1 
£h1† 25.¢f2 £f3† 26.¢g1 ¦h1 mate 23...¥f3!  Black has plenty of pawns for the piece, and 
a winning attack. Or 23...¦h4!? 24.£xg2 ¦xf4–+. 24.£b3 After 24.¤xh5 ¤xh5–+ White’s king 
is naked and Black’s troops are incoming (or 24...£g4†). 24...¦h4 25.¥d6 £h3 26.¥xf7† ¢h7 
27.£b2 ¤g4 0–1 Mate is coming. 


853. Alexander Morozevich – Vladimir Kramnik, Moscow 2009
Black is clearly better, but has a way to break through right now. 30...¤xf2! 31.¢xf2 £c2† 
32.¢g1 32.¢f1 £d3† 33.¢f2 £e3† does not help White. 32...£d1† 33.¢f2 33.¢g2 £e2† 
34.¢g1 £xf3–+  33...£xh1–+  0–1


854. Viswanathan Anand – Vladimir Kramnik, Zurich 2013
22.¦xa6! ¦xa6 23.£xd3 A double threat. 23...£xb2 23...£a8 24.£xe2+–  24.¦b1 ¦d6 
25.£xe2+–  The game ended swiftly: 25...£a2 25...¦xd2 26.¦xb2 ¦xe2 27.¦xe2+– 26.£b5 
c6 27.£b2 1–0 White’s two pieces and the passed a-pawn are much stronger than a rook and 
c-pawn. 


855. Vladimir Kramnik – Daniel Fridman, Dortmund 2013
29.¤d5! Opening up the way to the king. 29...exd5 30.¥xf6+–  1–0 Threatening ¤g7†, and 
the bishop cannot be taken due to mate. Black chose to resign since trying to create an escape 
square does not help: 30...¤b8 31.¥g7 £e7 32.¤f6† White wins the queen and the game.


856. Vladimir Kramnik – Anton Korobov, Tromsø 2013
37.¥h6! Threatening 38.¦b8† ¥e8 39.£g6†. Other moves are better for White, but this is the 
only winning move. 37.¦b8† ¢g7 38.¥h6†? even loses: 38...¢xh6 39.¦h8† ¢g5–+ 37...¤c7 
37...f5 38.£a1!  £c3 (38...e5 39.£xe5 £xh6 40.¦b8†+–) 39.£a8†! This is the difference 
between placing the queen on a1 and b2. White wins after 39...¢h7 40.£f8!. 38.£b4! The 
game continued 38.¦a7 which is also winning: 38...¤b5 39.£b4 ¤d6 40.£b8† ¤e8 41.¦e7+– 
 
(1–0, 51 moves) 38...¢h7 39.£f8+– Black has to give up the bishop on f7 to avoid mate.


857. Vladimir Kramnik – Levon Aronian, Khanty-Mansiysk (2) 2014
35.¦g1! Instead, the game continued 35.¥xf8?! exf1=£† 36.¦xf1 ¦xg2 37.£xg2 ¥xg2† 
38.¢xg2 ¦xf8² (½–½, 60 moves). White is also slightly better after 35.¥g5 exf1=£† 36.¦xf1 
¦xg2 37.£xg2 ¥xg2† 38.¢xg2 ¥h6. 35...¥xh6 Black also loses after 35...exd1=£ 36.£xd1!  
with a double threat and 35...e1=£ 36.¦dxe1 ¦xg2 37.£xg2! (37.¦xg2?? ¦xe1 mate) 37...¥xg2† 
38.¢xg2.  36.¦de1+–  The material advantage is large enough to win.


858. Vladimir Kramnik – Peter Svidler, Sochi 2015
26.¤e6! A nice discovery/closing tactic. Either the king is mated or the queen is lost. 26.e6 is not 
the way to go: 26...¥xe4 27.£xf7†? (27.exf7† ¢h7 28.¥xe4 ¥xd4 29.¥xg6† ¢h8 30.¥b2 e5=) 
27...¢h8–+ But 26.¦g4!? £xa2 27.¥b2+– is also quite strong. 26...¥xe6 26...¥xe4 27.£xf7† 
¢h7 28.£xg7 mate  27.¦xc4+–  (1–0, 30 moves)


859. Laurent Fressinet – Vladimir Kramnik, Paris (rapid) 2016
The bishop on c7 has a nice line of sight to the white king, so Black just needs some smart 
sacrifices to make full use of it. 22...¤xh3! 23.gxh3 ¦xf3–+ White can’t take back: 24.£xf3?! 
e4  And the queen has to go.


860. Vassily Ivanchuk – Viswanathan Anand, Buenos Aires 1994
31.¦xg7†! ¢xg7 32.¥d4† f6 32...¤e5 33.£e3+– is similar. 33.£e3!+–  The queen penetrating 
to h6 decides the game; Black tried to prevent the immediate threats, but to no avail. 33.¥xa1 
£xa1 34.£e3 should also win, but much more slowly and with some work still to be done. 
33...¤f8 34.¥e4 ¢f7 34...g5 is not a defence with the bishop on d4, due to 35.£xg5†. 35.¦h8 
1–0 Black resigned in view of £h6 with mate following. 


861. Veselin Topalov – Viswanathan Anand, Dos Hermanas 1996
18.¥g5! ¦xa1 18...£e8 19.¦xa8 £xa8 20.¥e7!  and White wins an exchange: 20...£xf3 
21.gxf3 ¤d3 22.¥xf8± 19.¥xd8 ¦xf1† 20.¢xf1  I believe White should win with correct 
play, but maybe Black can find a fortress. Topalov did not manage to crack Anand’s defence.


862. Viswanathan Anand – Miguel Illescas, Leon (3) 1997
White is a pawn up, but Black has some counterplay against the pawns on g3 and f4. 38.e5! 38.¤f3? 
£b2†=; 38.£c4?! ¤e1† 39.¢f2 hxg3†!? 40.¢xe1 £a1† 41.¢e2 g2 42.£c7! g1=£ 43.¥xg1 £xg1± 
38...dxe5 38...£f5 loses to 39.£xf5 gxf5 40.exd6+– and a passive move is hopeless: 38...£e7 
39.¤e4+– (or 39.¤f3 ¥h6 40.e6+–, or even 39.e6+–) 39.¤e4 £f5 40.¤g5† ¢h6 41.£g8!  
41.£xf5 gxf5 42.¤xf7† ¢g6 43.¤xe5† ¤xe5 44.fxe5 ¥xe5 45.gxh4 also wins. 41...¤xf4† 42.gxf4 
£c2† 43.¥f2 1–0 Black is out of constructive ways to protect against the mate.


863. Aleksandar Kovacevic – Viswanathan Anand, Belgrade 1997
29...¤bxd3! 30.¥xd3 Instead the game ended: 30.¦f1 £xe4 0–1 30...¦b3 31.£c2 ¦xd3 
31...¤xd3? 32.£xb3 ¤xe1 33.£d1² 32.b4 £a4!  0–1 By trading queens, Black saves both the 
knight and the rook, leaving him with a winning position.


864. Vassily Ivanchuk – Viswanathan Anand, Linares 1998
22...¦xc2! 23.¢xc2 £xa2–+  The threat of ...¦c8† is deadly. The game came to a logical 
conclusion with: 24.f4 ¦c8† 25.¢d2 ¥xf4† 26.¢e2 £xb2† 27.¢f3 ¦c1 0–1


865. Julen Arizmendi Martinez – Viswanathan Anand, Villarrobledo (rapid) 1998
25.¤f6†? White goes for the jugular, but Black can parry the attack and gain a winning position. 
The only move was 25.¦d1  when 25...£c8 26.¤f6† ¢h8 27.¤xe8 £xe8 gives White more 
than enough compensation for the pawn, especially after 28.£c3! f6 29.£c7± with a double 
threat (30.¦d7 and 30.£xa7). 25...¥xf6 26.£xf6 ¦xe1† 27.¢h2 £d6† 28.f4 £f8! 29.¥xf8 
¦xf8–+ (0–1, 40 moves)


866. Loek van Wely – Viswanathan Anand, Monte Carlo (rapid) 1999
22...d3! 22...¤e8 23.¦c8 d3 transposes to 23...¤e8 in the main line. 23.¦c8† 23.¦d2 ¦bb1–+ 
23...¢f7! Full points also for 23...¤e8 24.¦xb8 dxc2 25.¦xe8† ¢f7 26.¦c8 ¦xc1† 27.¢f2 when 
White’s king is close enough to stop the c-pawn, but Black gets a winning pawn or rook ending 
after 27...a5 28.¢e3 ¦e1†! 29.¢d2 ¦g1. But 23...¦xc8? 24.¦xc8† ¢f7 25.¢f2 is only equal. 
24.¦2c7† ¢g6 25.¢f2 25.¦xb8 d2–+  25...¦xc1! 0–1 After 26.¦xc1 d2!–+  Black wins a 
rook, remaining a piece up.


867. Viswanathan Anand – Ljubomir Ljubojevic, Monaco (blindfold) 2000
27.e5! dxe5 28.£e4!  Also full points if your idea was 28.¤e4 £d8 29.¤d6+–. 28...¢g8 
28...g6 29.hxg6† ¢g7 30.gxf7† ¢f8 31.¥c5† ¤e7 32.¦g8† ¢xf7 33.£h7† ¥g7 34.£xg7 mate 
29.¥c5 1–0 The black king cannot escape. Or 29.£h7† mating.


868. Sinisa Drazic – Viswanathan Anand, Bastia 2000
Black wins by attacking the weak spots h2 and f2: 28...¤g4! 29.g3 29.f4 exf3 (Even stronger 
– full points and almost a bonus point – is attacking f4 with 29...¤e6–+.) 30.¤xf3 ¤xe3 
 
(or 30...¦xb3 first) 31.£d2 ¦xb3µ  29...£f6!–+ 


869. Viswanathan Anand – Victor Bologan, New Delhi (2) 2000
38.g6! Not 38.¤xh7? ¢xh7 39.g6† ¢g8! 40.¦f3 ¦h5!µ. 38...fxg6 38...hxg6 39.£h4† ¦h5 
40.¤xh5+–  39.¤d7!  White crashes through. Also full points for: 39.¤xh7 ¥e7 40.¤f8!+– 
39...¥e7 39...¦e8 40.¤xf8+– 40.¤xe5 dxe5 41.£f7 h6 42.£e8† 1–0


870. Viswanathan Anand – Elizbar Ubilava, Villarrobledo (rapid) 2001
31.¦xf6! ¦xf6 32.£e7† ¦f7 33.£xh4+–  1–0 The d-pawn and Black’s weak king are sufficient 
to warrant resignation.


871. Viswanathan Anand – Alexey Dreev, Moscow (2) 2001
26.¦xd8† 26.¥xg7†? ¢h7–+ White can no longer take on d8 with check. 26...¦xd8 27.¥xg7†! 
¢h7 27...¤xg7 28.£h4!+–  wins the rook thanks to the threats along the h-file. 28.£c7!  
Anand managed to convert his advantage. 28.£h4 ¦d2 29.¥xh6 ¢xh6 30.g4 £g5 31.£xh5† 
£xh5 32.¦xh5† also scores full points. 28...¦g8 29.¥d4 ¦xg2 30.£xb7+– 


872. Nigel Short – Viswanathan Anand, Dubai 2002
16...¤xd5! 17.exd5 17.£xd5 ¥xb2µ 17...¤e5! 0–1 Short had no good moves: a) 18.£d2

873. Viswanathan Anand – Judit Polgar, Cap d’Agde 2003
20...¥xd4! 21.¥xd4 ¥xa2†! 22.¢xa2 After the game move 22.¢c1 many moves are winning. 
22...£a5† Or first 22...b3†. 23.¢b1 23.¢b3 and, among others, 23...¤b6 with mate to follow: 
24.¥xb6 ¦c3†! 25.bxc3 £a3† 26.¢c4 £xc3 mate 23...b3! 24.cxb3 £xd2–+  0–1


874. Miso Cebalo – Viswanathan Anand, Bastia 2003
22.¦xd5? A red herring – White should not bite into the bait. 22.¥xf8? is also bad: 22...¦xd1† 
23.¥xd1 (23.¦xd1 ¥xf3 24.gxf3 ¦xf8–+) 23...¥e4–+ Best is 22.¦de1² but any move that does 
not exchange too many pieces earns a full point. 22...¥xd5 23.¦h5? White can win the h-pawn 
with 23.¥xf8 ¢xf8 24.£xh7 but Black’s king is safe enough after 24...f6µ. 23.¥xd5 £xd5µ also 
leads nowhere. 23...£xh5 0–1 24.¥xh5 is met by 24...¥e4–+.


875. Evgeny Miroshnichenko – Viswanathan Anand, Porz 2004
27...¤xg3! 27...f4?! 28.gxf4 ¤xf4 29.¦ef2÷ ¦d3? 30.£xd3 ¤xd3 31.¦xf8 mate 28.¦ef2 Not 
a critical move, as there is now more than one way to win. The main point is: 28.¦xg3 f4–+  
28...¤xe4 Or 28...f4–+ with the point 29.¦xf4 ¦xf4 30.¦xf4 £xf4 31.£xf4 ¤e2†. 29.¤xe4 
¥xe4 Black should be winning and White soon resigned. But not: 29...fxe4? 30.¦xf8† ¦xf8

36.¦xe5+–  White will get too many and too dangerous pawns for either an exchange or 
a piece; in either case winning. The game finished: 36...¦4f5 37.£h6† ¢g8 38.£xh4 ¦xe5 
39.£g3† 1–0

30...¦e3! 30...fxg3 31.hxg3 ¥xg3 32.£xe2 ¥h2†! 33.¢xh2 ¥f1† 34.¢g1 ¥xe2µ and White has 
good chances to achieve a fortress. 31.fxe3 £xf3–+  With a winning attack which concluded:

880. Magnus Carlsen – Viswanathan Anand, Nice (rapid) 2008
19.¥xh7†! While not winning any material permanently, the trades that result from this combination 
release the pressure on White, leaving him a pawn up. 19...¢xh7 20.£b1† g6 21.£xb6± 


881. Viswanathan Anand – Loek van Wely, Wijk aan Zee 2013

882. Viswanathan Anand – Wei Yi, Leon 2016
32.e5! Winning the c6- or d4-pawns. Anand didn’t win the pawn: 32.¦a8?! £xa8 33.£xd6

884. Ruslan Ponomariov – Boris Ponomariov, Alicante 1997
21...¥xb2?! The start of an incorrect combination. Give yourself full points for every other 
normal move, for example 21...¥e6. It is unclear whether the compensation is 100% there, but it 
is at least partial compensation. 22.¦xb2 ¥xh3? The immediate double threat 22...£e5 loses to 
23.£d8†. 23.gxh3 £e5 Apparently a double attack. 24.c3!+– But it could be parried! White is 
winning, and did indeed win in 33 moves. 24.¥f3? is not good enough: 24...¦h4–+


885. Ruslan Ponomariov – Vepa Malikgulyew, Zagan 1997
16.£g3! 16.¤xe7† is better for White, but does not win material, as is also the case with 16.¥f4±. 
16...£xg3 17.¤xe7† ¢h8 18.hxg3 ¦e8 19.¤xc6+–  (1–0, 34 moves)


886. Sergei Azarov – Ruslan Ponomariov, Artek 1999
20.¦xf6! 20.£h4± 20...g6+– 20...gxf6 21.¥f4+–  traps the queen. In the game, Black fought 
on for a few more moves.


887. Sergei Tiviakov – Ruslan Ponomariov Moscow (4) 2001
23...¤h3†! 23...¦g8? 24.£f6† ¦g7 25.£xd8†+– 24.gxh3 ¦g8  0–1 Winning the queen. 


888. Ruslan Ponomariov – Teimour Radjabov, Wijk aan Zee 2003
35...¤ce3! Blocking the bishop on c5 while stopping ¤xg4. Three alternatives: a) 35...¤xf2 
36.¥xf8 ¤h3† 37.¢h1 ¤f2† 38.¢g1=; b) 35...¤e1 36.¢f1!µ; c) 35...¤d4? 36.¤xg4+– 
36.¥xe3 ¤xe3!  36...£xe3!? 37.¦f1 is also winning for Black, but not as forcing (full points 
for that evaluation). The game move is the strongest with ...£e2-f3 as the main winning idea. The 
game ended after just two more moves: 37.h4 £e2 38.£h5 g4 0–1


889. Ruslan Ponomariov – Tihomir Dovramadjiev, Internet 2004
30.¦exd5! ¦xd5 Instead Black tried 30...¦dc8+– but could not turn the game around 
 
(1–0, 42 moves). 31.¦xd5 exd5 32.£e5†+–  Picking up the rook.


890. Comp Hydra – Ruslan Ponomariov, Bilbao 2005
27.d7! Opening up for the queen to join the attack. 27...¥xc5 28.£c7!+–  White’s threats 
against the king are too strong. The game ended after the next move. 28...e5 29.dxc5 1–0 White 
is mating. 


891. Levon Aronian – Ruslan Ponomariov, Khanty-Mansiysk (3) 2005
14.b4!! 14.¥d6?! ¦e8 15.b4 cxb4 16.axb4 allows 16...¤f6=. 14...cxb4 15.£b3! White will 
win back a pawn on either b4 or d5, and retain material-winning threats. 15...¤c5 15...bxa3 
16.£xd5+–  and the rook cannot be saved. 15...£e7 16.£xd5 (16.¦hc1 is also quite strong) 
16...¤f6 17.£xa8 ¥b7 18.¥d6!!  saves the queen, keeping a winning material advantage. 
16.dxc5+–  (1–0, 73 moves)


892. Ruslan Ponomariov – Alexander Grischuk, Sochi 2006
30.¦c7! Winning one of the bishops. Not 30.bxc6?? £b1 mate. 30...¥f3!? 31.¥xf3! 31.£xc5 
£xc5 32.¦xc5 ¥xe2 33.¤xe3± probably also offers decent winning chances. 31...¥d6 32.¦c6 
1–0 Black resigned, since White is winning on the queenside after 32...¥xe5 33.¦xb6 ¦xb6 
34.fxe5 .


893. Krishnan Sasikiran – Ruslan Ponomariov, Zafra 2007
29.¤e5!!  1–0 Finding the soft target on f7; Black has no defence. 


894. Ruslan Ponomariov – Peter Leko, Moscow (blitz) 2007
19.¥xe6! ¦d8 19...fxe6? 20.¤f5+–  wins the bishop and the e6-pawn. 20.¤f5+– White has 
won an important pawn. 20.f4 is also good, as is the passive 20.¥b3.


895. Pavel Tregubov – Ruslan Ponomariov, Odessa 2008
28.¦b5†! White gains a mating attack. 28...¢a6+– 28...cxb5 29.¦d6†  ¢a7 and there is more 
than one way to mate, for instance 30.£d7† ¢a8 31.¦a6† ¢b8 32.¦b6† ¢a8 33.£b7 mate. 
29.¦xa5† 29.¢d2 and 29.¢c2 are also winning. 29...¢b6 30.£c5† 1–0 Mate is nigh.


896. Vladislav Tkachiev – Ruslan Ponomariov, Moscow (blitz) 2008
17.¥f4!  1–0 Mating on e8 or winning a bishop on c7. 


897. Magnus Carlsen – Ruslan Ponomariov, Moscow (blitz) 2008
28.¦xe6!! 28.¥xc5 runs into 28...£f7!µ, but White doesn’t have to exchange on c5 before 
capturing the e6-pawn. 28...¤xe6 29.¥d5 ¦e8 29...¢f7 30.¥xg7! and White is winning because 
the rook will be hanging after 30...£xg7 31.¥xe6† . 30.c7! ¢f7 31.¥xg7! £g8 31...£xg7 
32.¥xe6† (or 32.£xg7† ¢xg7 33.¥xe6+–) 32...¦xe6 33.£xg7† ¢xg7 34.c8=£+–  32.¥f6!+– 
Black is quite tied up and will end up losing a lot of material. 32.h4 is also winning. Instead the 
game continued 32.¥d4?! ¢e7 33.¥b6 when Black could have played 33...¦f8±.


898. Boris Gelfand – Ruslan Ponomariov, Khanty-Mansiysk (6) 2009
35.¦xd5 exd5 36.¤f4! In order to exploit the pin, the knight needs to attack the b6-rook from 
d5. 36.¤b2? ¢e7² 37.¤a4?! ¦xa6= 36...¤c7 36...d4 37.¤d5 ¦b8 38.¤c7+– 37.¦xb6 axb6 
38.a7+–  The principles of knight endgames are often the same as in pawn endgames, and 
here the advanced and distant passer on a7, and all the weak black pawns, give White a winning 
endgame (1–0, 52 moves).


899. Ruslan Ponomariov – Baadur Jobava, Kharkov 2010
30...¤f2! Discovered attack. 30...¤f4? has the same idea but runs into: 31.¤xf4 ¦xh2? 
32.¤xg6†+– 31.¥xf2 One point is 31.¦xh7 ¦xh7 32.¦xh7 ¤xd3 33.¦xe7 ¤xe1†!–+ when 
Black has an extra piece. 31...¦xh2 32.¦xh2 ¦xh2–+  (0–1, 79 moves)


900. Francisco Vallejo Pons – Ruslan Ponomariov, Spain 2011
32...¤e3! The threat of ...£g2 mate cannot be stopped except by capturing the knight – a move 
that decisively opens up the king’s position. 32...¦xf2 allows White to draw with 33.£xd5† or 
33.£d8†. 33.fxe3 £xe3†  34.¢g2 ¦f2† Mating is best, but other moves are winning as well. 
35.¢h3 £h6† 36.¢g4 £g6† 0–1


901. Sergey Fedorchuk – Ruslan Ponomariov, Spain 2011
21.¥xh6†! ¢g6 21...¢xh6 22.£xf6† ¢h7 (22...¢h5 also runs into mate in several ways. Most 
direct is 23.¦g3.) 23.£h4† ¢g8 24.¦g3† ¥g4 25.¦xg4 mate  22.¤d5! 22.¥xf8 ¥xc3 23.£g3† 
¤g4 24.¦f1 ¥d4 25.¦f3 And h2-h3 eventually wins the knight and the game (full points). In the 
game, White had a winning attack. The knight cannot be taken and the game ended in mate in 
a few moves. 22...¤h7 Both 22...¥xd5 23.£f5† ¢xh6 24.£xf6† and 22...¤xd5 23.£g3† will 
end up with mate. 23.£g3† ¢h5 24.¤f6† ¤xf6 25.£g5 mate


902. Peter Svidler – Ruslan Ponomariov, Eilat (1) 2012
34.¥d5! Two tries that don’t really work are 34.¥xg6? ¥xg6 35.¦g7† ¢f8µ and 34.¦xf7?! ¢xf7 
35.¥xg6† ¢xg6 36.¤f4† ¢f7 37.g6† ¢xf6 38.¦xe8=. 34...¦xe2 34...¥xd5 35.¦xe8 mate  
35.¥xf7†! ¢f8 35...¢h8 36.¦b8† ¢h7 37.¥g8† ¢h8 38.¥e6† Picking up the knight spells the 
end of the game. 36.¥xg6!  White has a winning attack. Black tried to fight on for a few moves, 
but it proved futile. 36...¦e8 37.¦f7† ¢g8 38.¦g7† ¢h8 39.¦h7† 1–0


903. Ruslan Ponomariov – Leinier Dominguez Perez, Tashkent 2012
33.¦xe7! Eliminating the defence of the dark squares. 33.¥c7?! ¦xc7 34.£xc7 £xc7 35.¦xc7 
¤c8 wins an exchange, but White is only slightly better. 33...£xe7 33...¦xe7 34.¤f6†  and 
as there are many ways to conclude the attack, it’s enough to see this far. A few lines: 34...¢h8 
(34...¢g7 35.£g5+– and the queen is coming to h6 with devastating effect) 35.£h4 h5 36.£g5 
£f8 37.¥d6 The defence is collapsing, since both e7 and f5 are hanging. It’s over after 37...¦cc7 
38.¦xf5+–. 34.¥g5!  34.¥e5!? or 34.d6!? and some other moves are good but not best or most 
natural. 34...£e2 35.¤f6† ¢g7 36.¤xe8† ¦xe8 37.¦xf5 1–0 Black has to give up the queen 
to delay mate after 37...gxf5 38.¥e7†! .


904. Deshun Xiu – Ruslan Ponomariov, Danzhou 2014
Despite the centralized position, the king is somewhat short of squares and must keep the rook 
protected. 42...f5†! 43.gxf5 gxf5† 44.¢e5 44.¢e3 ¦de2 mate  44...¦xd3–+  (0–1, 50 moves)


905. Fabiano Caruana – Ruslan Ponomariov, Dortmund 2014
How can White exploit the weak light squares around the king? 39.¦e7! First, we must deflect 
the queen by attacking c7. 39...£xe7 39...¢b8 40.¥a6  is mating. 40.¥a6! And then the king 
is deflected! White mates. 40...¢xa6 41.£a8 mate 


906. Ivan Cheparinov – Ruslan Ponomariov, Tromsø (ol) 2014
19.¤b5! Pin, discovered check and pawn promotion are on the agenda. 19...¦cc8 The main 
point is 19...¥xb5 20.¦xd8† ¥xd8 21.cxb6† ¦e7 22.bxa7+–  and promotion. 20.¤xa7 ¦c7 
21.cxb6 White is winning (1–0, 37 moves).


907. Ruslan Ponomariov – Jure Borisek, Berlin (blitz) 2015
26.¤f5! Using the cramped king to bring the knight to the lovely d6-square, winning an 
exchange. 26...£e6 26...gxf5 27.£g5† ¥g7 28.£xg7 mate  27.¤d6+–  (1–0, 55 moves)


908. Ruslan Ponomariov – Axel Bachmann, Berlin (blitz) 2015
24.¥xf6 ¥xf6 25.¥a6! Taking advantage of all the unprotected minor pieces. 25...¤xa4 
25...¥xa6 26.¦xb6+–  wins a piece. 26.¦xb7 White is a piece up (1–0, 55 moves).


909. Ruslan Ponomariov – Francisco Vallejo Pons, Madrid 2016
24.e4! 24.e6† ¢xe6 25.e4 is similar but 24.¦d1? runs into 24...¥b7!–+. 24...£d4 24...£xe4 drops 
the bishop: 25.¦xd2+–  25.¦d1  1–0 Now there is no counterplay, so the pins win the bishop.


910. Rustam Kasimdzhanov – Patrice Verdier, Corsica (rapid) 1997
34.¤xg6! £d3 No better are 34...fxg6 35.£xf8+–  or 34...¢xg6 35.£f5 mate . 35.¤xf8†  
1–0 Mate is on the way.


911. Rustam Kasimdzhanov – Giorgi Bakhtadze, Yerevan 1999
40.¤e6†! A discovered attack with an added threat to the f4-knight. Black has a fork, but White 
emerges with a winning position. 40...¢e7 40...¤xe6 41.¦xd7 ¤f6 (41...¦xc4 42.¤xc4 ¤f6 
43.¤e5+–  or 43.¦a7 ¤xg4† 44.¢g3!+–) 42.¥xe6! (42.¦f4+– is also good enough) 42...fxe6 
43.¦f4!+–  41.¦xd7† ¢xd7 42.¤xf4  1–0


912. Rustam Kasimdzhanov – Gerald Hertneck Germany 2001
24.¦xc5! Distracting the crucial defender of b7 to a vulnerable square. Worse are 24.£b5 ¦b6= 
and 24.¤c6? ¦dxc6 25.¥b7† ¦xb7 26.£xc6 c4µ. 24...¦xc5 25.¥b7† £xb7 26.¦xb7 ¢xb7 
27.£b4†!+–  White wins a rook, with a winning material advantage.


913. Etienne Bacrot – Rustam Kasimdzhanov, Moscow 2002
24...¦xf3! 24...¥xe4?! 25.¥xe4 ¦xe4 26.fxe4 £f2† 27.¢h1 £e2 28.¥g5± is bad for Black and 
24...¥h3†? 25.¢xh3 ¦xf3† 26.¢g2 ¦f2† 27.¢h1! loses for him. 25.¢xf3 White tried the 
 
non-critical 25.£c4 when 25...¥g4! is precise, but other moves win too. 25...¥xe4† 26.¢g3 
26.¢xe4 £d4 mate  26...£f2†  0–1 Mate is coming.


914. Thomas Luther – Rustam Kasimdzhanov, Mainz 2003
21...h4! Chasing away the blocking knight prepares a fork. 22.¤e4 ¥xe4 23.dxe4 ¤h3† 24.¢f1 
¤xf2–+  (0–1, 34 moves)


915. Rustam Kasimdzhanov – Mark Bluvshtein, Khanty-Mansiysk (ol) 2010
34.£g6†! Trading the attack for a win by promotion. 34...£xg6 35.¤xg6 1–0 The pawn queens 
after 35...¢xg6 36.d7  and 35...¥e6 36.¤f8† is a fork.


916. Rustam Kasimdzhanov – Mohammad Miran Khademi, Mashhad 2011
39.¦xe8! 39.c5†? ¤xc5 40.¤c4† ¢e6–+ 39...¦8a7!? 39...a1=¤† leads nowhere and 39...¦xe8 is 
met by 40.¦d7 mate . 40.c5†! 1–0 The end was close: 40...¤xc5 41.¤c4 mate 


917. Rustam Kasimdzhanov – Liviu Dieter Nisipeanu, Rogaska Slatina 2011
29.¤c5!  The only way to get out of the dangerous pin, while only losing one of the hanging 
pieces. White retains an exchange – a winning material advantage (1–0, 40 moves). No good is: 
29.hxg3 fxg3 30.¤c5 gxf2†³


918. Rustam Kasimdzhanov – Marat Dzhumaev, Tashkent 2011
24.g4! ¤c2 24...¥xg4 25.£f7† ¢h8 26.£xh7 mate  25.gxf5+–  Kasimdzhanov played 
another winning move (also full points): 25.£xd4 ¤xd4 26.¦d1 e3 27.¦xd4 ¦xc7 28.¥d5† 1–0


919. Rustam Kasimdzhanov – Henrik Teske, Germany 2011
38.f7! ¥xf7 The game continued 38...¥c6+– when White has several winning options. For 
example: 39.¦d6 (another is 39.¥f3 ¦xe1 40.¤xc6+– attacking both rooks) 39...¥d5 (39...¥a8 
40.¦d7+–) 40.¦xd5! Black resigned in view of 40...¤xd5 41.¦e8† mating. 39.¤xf7 ¢xf7 
40.¥h5†+–  Winning the rook.


920. Dimitar Donchev – Veselin Topalov, Sofia 1989
18.¤fe5!! Threatening the d7-knight and preparing a discovered attack on the queen. 18...¥xe5 
19.¤h6†!  1–0 19.¤f6†?? ¤xf6–+


921. Eran Liss – Veselin Topalov, Singapore 1990
28.f5!! White wants to force away the g7-bishop that is blocking the mate on f7. 28...dxe3 The 
game continued 28...¤xf5 29.£g8† (other moves also win, but not 29.¥xf5 dxe3²) 29...¢e7 
30.£f7† ¢d6 31.£d7† and Black resigned, as he was facing mate in a few moves. After 28...gxf5 
White wins with, among others, 29.¥h6. 29.f6+– 


922. Vasilios Kotronias – Veselin Topalov, Kavala 1990
20.¤xe6!+– Winning an important pawn and gaining a superb knight on e6. 20...¥c6 20...£xe6 
fails to 21.¦xd7†+–  when the rook is indirectly protected by the queen. 21.f5! e4 22.¥d4 
¦hg8 23.¤xe4 ¥xe4 24.£xe4 c3 25.b4 1–0 White has a crushing position.


923. Veselin Topalov – Jacob Bjerre Jensen, Copenhagen 1991
28...¤f4!! What a multipurpose move! Black cuts off the queen from the mate threat, threatens 
the bishop, opens the h-file for either the queen on h6 or a rook on h5. White is utterly defenceless 
against so many threats. The game ended the other way after: 28...£e7?! 29.¥h3 ¦xe5 30.dxe5 
£xe5?? (30...£g5=) 31.¦d8† 1–0 29.£xf4 ¦h5†! 30.¦xh5 £xf4–+


924. Veselin Topalov – Juan Mellado Trivino, Terrassa 1992
22.¤d6! Cutting off the defence of d5. 22...¤b4 22...¥xd6 23.£xd5†+–  23.¤xe8+–  
White has won an exchange and will gain control of the soon-to-be-open e-file.


925. Mikhail Nedobora – Veselin Topalov, Candas 1992
25...e4! Breaking up White’s pawn structure and giving the bishop on h2 a retreat square. 
26.¦e3 26.fxe4 ¥e5!–+  and Black will win on the kingside. 26...exf3–+ The white kingside is 
collapsing. The game gives some indication of White’s troubles here. However, 26...¥e5–+ is also 
winning. 27.¦xf3 ¤e4 27...¥e5 is still a winning idea. 28.¢c2 ¤g5 29.¦f2 ¥e5 30.¥xe5 ¦xe5 
31.¦h1 ¦e4 32.¦g1 ¤f3 33.¦h1 ¤e5 34.¢d2 0–1


926. Jesus Maria Iruzubieta Villaluenga – Veselin Topalov, Elgoibar 1992
34...¤xg5!!  0–1 34...£b6†?! allows 35.£e3!= when 35...£xe3† 36.¦xe3 ¤xg5? 37.¤xe5 even 
wins for White. In the game, White resigned in view of the heavy material losses: 35.¦xe5 ¤xf3† 
(or 35...¤h3†)


927. Veselin Topalov – Alfonso Romero Holmes, Leon 1993
24.¥h6! Neutralizing all counterplay and getting rid of the supreme defender by exploiting 
the multiple pins created by White’s pieces aimed against the black king. 24...£c3 24...¥xh6 
25.£xg6† ¥g7 26.£xh5+–  (or 26.¦xh5+–) 25.¥xg7  White has a winning attack. 25...£xg7 
26.¦dg1 1–0 After 26...¤f6 27.£xg6+– it’s hopeless.


928. Jesus Maria De la Villa – Veselin Topalov, Pamplona 1994
35...¦xh8! 36.¦xh8 ¢f6!–+  Gaining a second piece for the rook gives Black a likely winning 
endgame (0–1, 49 moves).


929. Veselin Topalov – Judit Polgar, Novgorod 1996
33.¦xe6†! 33.d5? is too slow after 33...¦xc2–+, but 33.¤a3 preserves an advantage (but is weak 
compared to the game). 33...¢f8 33...fxe6 34.£xe6†+–  and one of the rooks drops. The game 
move is clever, and gives Black a double threat against c2 and e6, so one has to see further. 34.£a3† 
34.¦g6!? is the only other move that wins. The point is still the check on a3: 34...¦xc2 35.£a3† 
34...¢g7 35.¦e7! ¦c7 36.¦xc7 £xc7 37.¤e3+–  The position has stabilized with White a pawn 
up, with the safer king, better minor piece and more dangerous pawns (1–0, 60 moves).


930. Loek van Wely – Veselin Topalov, Antwerp 1997
33...c2†! 34.¢a2 34.¦xc2 £e1†–+  wins the rook. 34.¢a1 £xa3 mate  34...£d2! 35.£f1 
£d4! 0–1 There is a double threat against a7 and b2.


931. Loek van Wely – Veselin Topalov, Monte Carlo (blindfold) 1997
26.¤e8†! 26.¦xh8?! ¢xh8 27.¤e8 ¤g8 and Black defends. 26...¢f7 27.¤xf6!±  (1–0, 39 
moves)


932. Predrag Nikolic – Veselin Topalov, Linares 1997
22...¤e5!! 0–1 22...¤f2†? 23.¦xf2 £xh3† 24.¢g1± The knight sacrifice opens up for a 
discovered attack on the pawn on h3: 23.fxe5 £xh3 mate 


933. Veselin Topalov – Jan Timman, Elista (ol) 1998
31...¥xh4! The queen now tried to do too much. 32.£d3?! 32.£xh4 ¦xd6 33.¦xd6? (33.¤e4µ) 
33...£xd6†–+ picks up the d2-knight. 32...¤f6!–+  White can’t retain the strong bishop on d6 
and faces huge material losses. 33.¥e7 £c7† 0–1


934. Alexei Shirov – Veselin Topalov, Sarajevo 2000
24.£xc5! Targeting the soft spot on h7 by getting the queen to f5. 24.h5? h6 25.¤xe4 is somewhat 
better for White, but nowhere near as convincing as the game continuation. 24...¤f4 24...f5 is 
met by 25.¤e6+–  or 25.¤xf5+–. 25.£f5  ¤g6 It is now enough to take the exchange, but 
Shirov was more direct. 26.h5! £xe7 27.hxg6 1–0


935. Francisco Vallejo Pons – Veselin Topalov, Barcelona 2000
28.¦xg5†! 28.£xf3? ¤xf3 29.¦xf6 (29.¦g3 ¥g7µ) 29...¤xg1 30.¤xg1 is unclear. 28...¢f8 
28...¥xg5 29.£xg5†  is a key move, after which White’s attack is winning in many ways; an 
evaluation that can be made without calculating further. But here we can afford some supporting 
variations. (29.¦h8†? ¢g7 30.¦h7† [30.£h7†? ¢f6–+ and the attack is over] 30...¢f6 31.¦xf7†! 
¤xf7 32.£xf3 ¤e5 And White is better, but not winning.) 29...¤g6 (29...¢f8 30.¦h8 mate) 
30.¥xg6 fxg6 (30...£d3† 31.¢a1 £d1† 32.¤c1 changes nothing) 31.¦xg6† ¢f7 32.¦g7† ¢f8 
33.¦g8† ¢f7 34.£g7 mate 29.¦xf6+–  White has won a piece, so trading queens is not really 
in Black’s interest, but if he does not, then the attack is winning. The only thing that might be 
useful to see is that Black runs out of checks after: 29...£d3† 30.¢c1 £e3† 31.¢d1 £d3† 
32.¢e1 £b1† 33.¢f2+–


936. Rafael Vaganian – Veselin Topalov, Istanbul (ol) 2000
30...£xe6!+– Giving up the queen to gain the time needed to promote the c-pawn. Worse 
are 30...£g7?! 31.£d3µ and 30...c2? 31.¦xf6 c1=£† 32.¢h2± and 30...¦b1†?! 31.¥f1 £h4³. 
31.dxe6 c2 32.£e3 ¦b1† 33.¢h2 c1=£–+  (0–1, 36 moves)


937. Veselin Topalov – Alexander Morozevich, Cannes 2002
33.¥e4 Double discovery with a threat on the knight and taking away the h7-square! Black 
resigned, since he is mated whichever rook he captures. 33...¤xf2† 33...¦xb5 34.¦a8†  
with mate. 34.¢g2 ¦ee8 35.¦xb8 ¦xb8 36.¢xf2+– 


938. Veselin Topalov – Peter Leko, Dubai 2002
22...¤e5! 23.£g3 23.£e2 ¤xg6 24.hxg6 £xg6–+ 23...¦xh5!–+  Something along the 
 
h7-b1 diagonal, or the d1-rook, will drop off (0–1, 27 moves). But not: 23...¤xg6? 24.hxg6 £h8 
25.£c7+–


939. Alexei Shirov – Veselin Topalov, Prague 2002
40.d7! Clearing a square for a fork while threating to queen the pawn. 40...¤xd7 41.¤d6† ¢g6 
42.¤xc4+–  (1–0, 52 moves)


940. Veselin Topalov – Evgeny Bareev, Dortmund (2) 2002
23.¤xb5†! Exposing Black’s king to the white artillery. 23.c4? ¦ac8µ is bad, but there are 
some decent alternatives: 23.£e5!?± and 23.a4!? b4±. 23...axb5 24.¦xb5! The move order is 
important. 24.¦xd5? exd5 25.¦xb5? ¦he8! wins for Black. 24...£c6 24...£a6 25.¦dxd5! (or the 
nice-looking 25.£e3† ¤xe3 26.¦d7†+–) 25...exd5 26.£e7†  mating. 24...£c7 defends against 
the check on e7. A rook lift is winning, as well as 25.¦dxd5 exd5 26.£e3† ¢a6 27.¦b4 £a5 
28.£e2† ¢a7 29.£e7† ¢a6 30.£b7 mate. 25.¦dxd5! 25.¦d4+– should also be good enough; as 
is 25.£d3+–. 25...exd5 26.£e7† ¢a6 27.¦b3!  1–0 The threat of 28.£a3 is decisive. 


941. Veselin Topalov – Francisco Vallejo Pons, Morelia/Linares 2006
34...£xe1†! 34...£xd5? 35.¦xe5†! wins for White and 34...fxg6 35.£e6† leads to a perpetual 
after the best moves. 35.¥xe1 ¥e3† 36.¢f1 c1=£ 37.£xf7† ¢d8–+  Because the e1-bishop 
is pinned, White does not have compensation (0–1, 56 moves).


942. Veselin Topalov – Gata Kamsky, Sofia 2009
36.¤xb4! 36.¦xd4? £xd4 37.¦xc7 ¤xd3 and the pawn on g7 is defended after 38.£xf7† ¢h8µ. 
36...axb4 37.¦xd4! £f8?! 37...£xd4 38.¦xc7±  is not winning, but this is clearly the best 
White could force from the diagram position. 38.¦xd8 £xd8 39.¦xc7 £xc7 40.£a8† ¢h7 
41.£e4† ¢g8 42.£xb4+–  (1–0, 55 moves)


943. Magnus Carlsen – Veselin Topalov, Sofia 2009
33.£d3! 33.£g4? £xe7 and 33.¤xg6? £xc7 both win for Black. 33...£xe7 33...£xc7 34.¤g5†! 
(34.¤f6†?? ¤xf6 35.£xg6† ¢h8–+) 34...hxg5 35.£xg6† ¢h8 36.£h5† ¥h6 37.£xh6 mate  
34.¦xd7 Or 34.¤f6†+–. 34...£h4† 35.¢f3! £h5† 36.¢g3!  1–0 Black has run out of 
counterplay, so White is simply mating.


944. Vladimir Georgiev – Veselin Topalov, Novi Sad 2009
37.¤f4! Clearing e6 for the queen while simultaneously threatening the black queen and protecting 
e2. 37...£h6 37...gxf4 38.£e6†  is mating. 38.£e6† ¢h8 39.¤h5! ¦f8 40.£xd6+–  
White just needs to take care of some counterplay in order to win quickly. Instead the game went 
40.¦f7? ¥g7 41.¦xg7? (41.£xh6 ¥xh6 42.¦d7 seems to be a slow win) 41...£xh5 and White 
had only a perpetual after 42.¦g8†.


945. Mark Bluvshtein – Veselin Topalov, Khanty-Mansiysk (ol) 2010
24.¤xd6! 24.¦xd6? ¥xd6 25.¤f6† ¢f7–+ 24...¥xd6 25.¦xd6! ¦xe2 25...¦xd6 26.£xe8† ¢g7 
27.£e7†  wins the rook on d6. 26.¦xd8† ¢f7 27.¥xe2+–  White should win and did 
indeed manage to convert (1–0, 42 moves).


946. Veselin Topalov – Magnus Carlsen, Astana (rapid) 2012
40.¤h5†! gxh5 40...¢f8 41.¤f6+–  (or 41.dxc5 bxc5 42.¤f6+–) A sample line is: 41...¤xf6 
42.£xf6 ¢g8 43.¦e8† ¢h7 44.£h8 mate 41.¦g5†! The game move 41.£xh5?= gives Black the 
opportunity to bring the knight to g6, with sufficient defensive resources. 41...¢f8 42.£xh5+–  
Now Black cannot parry the mating attack.


947. Wang Hao – Veselin Topalov, Stavanger (blitz) 2013
21.¤d5! £xb3 21...£a7 22.¤e7† or 22.¤c7+–. 22.£xb3 ¤xb3 23.¤c7+–  White wins an 
exchange with a much more active position. 23...¦e5 24.¤xa8 ¦xg5 25.¦xd7 ¥xd7 26.¦xd7 
1–0


948. Sarunas Sulskis – Magnus Carlsen, Moscow 2004
34.¤d5! ¢h7 34...£xd5? 35.h6+–  mating, is the main idea. Black’s best is 34...£xf6 35.¤xf6† 
¢g7 36.¤xd7  ¦d8± with some drawing chances. 35.hxg6†! fxg6 36.£e7† 1–0 If 36...¢g8 
then 37.¤f6† wins everything.


949. Magnus Carlsen – Kjetil Lie, Trondheim 2004
33...¤xe5! 34.fxe5 34.¥h4µ 34...¦xe5 A double threat, winning back the piece while keeping 
the pawn. 35.¥f4 35.¤xc7 ¦xg5–+  and the knight is trapped on c7. 35...¦xd5–+  
(0–1, 44 moves)


950. Magnus Carlsen – Nurlan Ibrayev, Calvia (ol) 2004
17.¦xf6! The king cannot escape without heavy casualties. 17...£xf6 After 17...hxg5 the most 
direct is 18.hxg5 gxf6 19.gxf6 mating. 17...gxf6 allows mate in two: 18.£h7† ¢f8 19.£xf7 
mate  18.£h7† ¢f8 19.¤e4! 19.¥a3† is less precise, but sufficient for a winning position: 
19...¤b4 20.¥xb4† d6+– And with the e4-square covered, White can’t play ¤g5-e4. 19...£e6 
20.¥a3†+– 


951. Magnus Carlsen – Vasilios Kotronias, Calvia (ol) 2004
22.¤xf6! White is better after other moves, but this is clearly the strongest continuation. 
22...¢xf6 23.¦xd6†! ¢e7 23...£xd6 24.£xe3 with a double threat against a7 and g5: 24...¦xh4 
25.£xa7+–  or 24...¦d7 25.£g5 mate . 24.¦xc6 £xc6 25.£xe3  With three pawns and 
Black’s exposed king for an exchange, White is at least clearly better, although the game was 
eventually drawn.


952. Alexander Graf – Magnus Carlsen, Sanxenxo 2004
29.¥c6!!  1–0 Black cannot protect both the bishop and the king against 30.¦d8†.


953. Magnus Carlsen – Predrag Nikolic, Wijk aan Zee 2005
20.¤g5†! fxg5 21.£f3†! ¢g8 22.¦xe6!  1–0 Winning the bishop with 22.¥f5+– is also good 
enough. The game move gives a winning attack: 22...¦xe6 23.£f8 mate.


954. Magnus Carlsen – Oystein Hole, Gausdal 2005
24.¥xh7! ¢xh7 24...¤xd4 25.¥xg8 (25.¤xd4? ¢xh7 26.¥e3 ¦h8! and Black is winning 
because the queen is protecting e6 and can come to g6 after 27.¤f5 exf5 28.£xf5† £g6–+) 
25...¤f5 26.¥xf7 ¤xh6 27.£xe6 £xe6 28.¥xe6+–  White has too many pawns to go with the 
rook against the two minor pieces. 25.¥e3! White threatens mate on h5 as well as a discovered 
attack with the knight. 25...¦h8 25...g6 26.£h3† (or 26.¤xe6+–) 26...¢g7 27.£h6 mate 
 
26.¤xe6+–  White wins the queen. Also good is: 26.¤f5 exf5 27.£xf5†+–


955. Magnus Carlsen – Gata Kamsky, Khanty-Mansiysk (1) 2005
37.c5†! ¢xc5 37...¢xb5 38.¦e7 should also be winning for White and 37...¢a7 is just too 
passive; White’s pawns and active rooks are decisive in many different ways. 38.¦e7 ¥d4 38...¥c3 
39.¦c7† (or 39.¦c1) 39...¢b6 (39...¢d4 40.¦d1†+– ) 40.¦xc3+–  39.¦xb7+– 


956. Jan Smeets – Magnus Carlsen, Wijk aan Zee 2006
35...¦xg3†!! 36.¢xg3 After the game move 36.¢f1 many moves win. Strongest is 36...£h7–+ 
 
when the queen penetrates with deadly effect. 36.fxg3 £f1†! (or 36...£f3†) 37.¢h2 ¢g7 
This wins similarly to the main line, although here White is closer to having a defence: 38.¦e4 
¦h8† 39.¦h4 ¥xh4–+  36...£f3† 37.¢h2 ¢g7!–+  Bringing the rook to the h-file with a 
devastating attack. 37...¦f7? 38.£xg6 ¦h7† 39.£xh7† ¢xh7÷ is not good enough.


957. Simon Williams – Magnus Carlsen, Reykjavik (blitz) 2006
23...¥h4 Winning an exchange by exploiting the mating threats on g2 and h1. 24.¦xe4 The 
alternatives do not require long calculation: 24.g3 £h1 mate  and 24.£xh4 £xg2 mate . 
24...¥xf2† 25.¦xf2 ¥xe4  Black should be winning.


958. Magnus Carlsen – Sergei Shipov, Tromsø 2006
34...d3! Clearing d4 for a fork. 35.¦e1 The fork is executed after 35.cxd3 ¤d4–+  and 35.£xd3 
¦fd8! 36.£f3 ¤d4–+ . The queen had no safe squares. 35...dxc2–+ White saved the exchange, 
but at too high a price – the c2-pawn supported by Black’s entire army is too much to handle.


959. Magnus Carlsen – Kjetil Lie, Moss 2006
24.¦xf7! ¤xf7 The game ended 24...¦xc2 25.¤e7† ¢h8 26.¥e5 mate. 25.¤f6† ¢f8 
 
26.¤xe8+–  White will win even more material.


960. Magnus Carlsen – Alexander Morozevich, Biel 2006
40.¦xd5! cxd5 41.£f8† ¢h7 42.¤e8! 1–0 With a decisive attack. 42...£e5† can be met by 
43.f4!  followed by 44.¤f6†.


961. Artur Yusupov – Magnus Carlsen, Amsterdam 2006
39...¤xf2! 40.¢xf2 The game went 40.¤f1–+. 40...£xg3† 41.¢e2 £xh2†–+  Or 41...¦a8–+.


962. Magnus Carlsen – Dmitry Gurevich, Rishon Le Zion (blitz) 2006
23.¤e6†! The only move that doesn’t lose material. 23...¥xe6 23...fxe6 24.¦xe5  with a 
winning endgame. 24.¦xe5  The endgame is winning for White.


963. Magnus Carlsen – Simen Agdestein, Oslo 2006
9.£d5! £f6 9...£e7 10.¤xe5+– 10.¤xe5!  10.¥g5 is good, but not as good: 10...£e6 11.¤xe5 
£xd5 12.¥xd5 ¤xe5 13.¥xa8 ¤d3†+– With work still to be done. 10...¤xe5 11.£xa8†+– 


964. Alexander Motylev – Magnus Carlsen, Wijk aan Zee 2007
28.¦e1! 28.g4? ¤g6 led to a draw in 44 moves, and 28...hxg4! 29.¦xe6? ¤f5 would be 
embarrassing for White, as suddenly Black is winning: 30.¦xe8 ¦xe8 31.£d2 ¤xd4 32.£xd4 
¦e2–+ 28...¤f5 After 28...¤g6 the pin on the e6-bishop is decisive. For example: 29.cxd5 cxd5 
30.¥xd5+– 29.cxd5! 29.¦xe6 ¤xd4 30.¦e7† ¦xe7 31.£xe7†= 29...¤xd4 29...cxd5 30.¦xe6 
¤xd4 31.¦e7† ¦xe7 32.£xe7† ¢g6 is now winning for White due to 33.¥xd5. 30.dxe6†+–  
White has won a pawn and has a strong attack.


965. Magnus Carlsen – Vassily Ivanchuk, Morelia/Linares 2007
25.d5! A pawn weaker is 25.¥xg7 ¢xg7 26.d5 exd5 27.¤d4 £xe5, but it’s still probably winning. 
25...exd5 26.¤d4+– 


966. Peter Leko – Magnus Carlsen, Monte Carlo (rapid) 2007
16...£g4†! The game continued 16...£xh1? 17.£a5 with a draw later on. Black should not be 
satisfied with 16...¢xb6–+, however 16...¥e7–+ is strong enough (full points). 17.¢f2 17.¢d2 
¥b4 mate  17...£h4†! 18.¢e2 ¥g4† 19.¢d2 ¥b4†–+  Winning the queen.


967. Emil Sutovsky – Magnus Carlsen, Kemer 2007
32.c6! dxc6 33.¥b4!+–  The threat of 34.d7† ¢d8 35.¥a5† is lethal. (The game continuation 
33.d7† ¢d8 34.¥b4! ¦xb4 35.¦xb4+– is also sufficient.)


968. Dmitri Jakovenko – Magnus Carlsen, Moscow 2007
32...¥xc4! 32...£f4† 33.¢h1 ¥xc4 34.¥xc4 ¦d2 also works, but only because 35.¦b2 ¦d1 
36.¦b1 is met by 36...£h6!–+ when the pinned rook on g1 can’t defend from g3. 33.£xc4 
33.¥xc4 ¦d2!  with a winning attack. 33...£f4†! 34.¦g3 34.¢h1 ¦xd5–+  34...¦xd5  
Black is winning, for instance: 35.£xd5 35.£c1 ¦d2–+ 35...¦xd5 36.exd5 c4–+


969. Vassily Ivanchuk – Magnus Carlsen, Nice (rapid) 2008
15.¥xh7†! 15.£e4 g6 16.¥xb4 ¤xb4 17.£xb7 £xd3÷ 15...¢xh7 16.£e4† ¢g8 17.¥xb4 
¤xb4 18.£xb7!±  White has won a pawn, but it didn’t stop Carlsen from making a draw. He 
would have made more after 18.£xb4? ¥xf3µ.


970. Magnus Carlsen – David Anton Guijarro, Madrid (simul) 2008
37.¦c4! Because of the control of a8, White breaks through on the queenside. 37...¦b8 37...¤b3 
38.¥d7+– (or 38.¥b7+– and the rook penetrates to c7) 38.¦xc5 bxc5 39.¥b7+–  The next 
move is 40.b6.


971. Magnus Carlsen – Leinier Dominguez Perez, Wijk aan Zee 2009
33.¦b7! Avoiding 33.¥xe5? £xb5 34.¥xg7† ¢g8µ and 33.¦b4 £c2 34.£xc2 ¥xc2 35.¥xe5=. 
33...£c2 33...¥xf1 34.¥xe5+–  34.£b4!  Or 34.£a3! also gives a winning attack. The game 
concluded: 34...¦fe8 35.¦e1 ¥e2 36.¤xe5 ¥xe5 37.¥xe5† ¦xe5 38.£xf4 £f5 39.£h6 1–0


972. Sergey Karjakin – Magnus Carlsen, Nice (blindfold) 2010
34...¦xh2†! 35.¦xh2 £xf3† 36.¢g1 Best. White loses immediately after 36.£g2 £d1† 
37.£g1 £xg1† 38.¢xg1 ¥xh2†–+  and 36.¦g2 £f1† 37.¦g1 £h3† 38.£h2 £xh2 mate .

974. Magnus Carlsen – Hikaru Nakamura, Medias 2011

35.cxb4 £d5! 36.h7† ¢h8 37.¥b2† ¦xb2†  38.¢xb2 £d2† With a perpetual.

Black forces the queen away from the attack on the kingside, with a clear advantage.


976. Magnus Carlsen – Levon Aronian, Wijk aan Zee 2012
30.¤xc6! ¦xc6 31.¤xd5 £xd4† After the game move 31...¦c2, White gains a large advantage 
after several moves: 32.¢h1+–, 32.£e4+– and 32.¦f2!+–. 32.¥e3 £xe5 33.¤e7† Or 33.¥f4 
first. 33...£xe7 34.¦xd8† £xd8 35.£xc6+– 


977. Evgeny Tomashevsky – Magnus Carlsen, Moscow (blitz) 2012
13.¥xe7! Not 13.¤xe7? ¤xg5–+ or 13.¥f4 e5². 13...¤xe7 14.¤xe7  ¥xb2 14...¦b8 15.£d6± 
After the game move, White has a positional advantage if he takes on a8, but there are two 
stronger continuations. 15.¦b1 15.¤xg6 fxg6 16.¥xa8 ¥xa1 17.£xa1+– 15...¥c3† Black is 
also lost after 15...¦b8 16.£d6 and 15...£xe7 16.¥xa8+– . 16.¢f1+– White is winning, but 
Carlsen turned the game around (0–1, 26 moves).


978. Magnus Carlsen – Teimour Radjabov, Astana (blitz) 2012
30.h4! The only way not to lose the bishop. It also makes use of the bishop’s active position and 
the pinned f6-pawn. 30...gxh4 31.g5+–  Black is defenceless against the a-pawn and White’s 
pressure on the kingside. 31...¦g6 32.¦ef2 1–0


979. Magnus Carlsen – Judit Polgar, Mexico City 2012
30...¤4xd5! Using the pinned e-pawn to win a piece, as the queen cannot protect the bishop. 
31.¥xg5 31.exd5 £xb4–+ 31...£xg5! 31...hxg5 32.£xb7 ¤f4 33.¥c4= and the threat of ¦h1 
saves White. 32.¦xg5 ¤xb4–+ 


980. Jon Ludvig Hammer – Magnus Carlsen, Stavanger (blitz) 2013
26...£xf3! The only move that decides the game on the spot. A clear advantage is offered by three 
other moves: a) 26...¤xf3†?! 27.exf3 £xf3 28.¥g2 £xg2† 29.£xg2 ¥xg2 30.¢xg2 ¦e2† 31.¢g1 
¥b2 and Black’s rook is stronger than White’s two pieces. b) 26...h5µ; c) 26...¥xf3?! 27.¤d4! 
£g4 28.¤xf3 ¦xf3 29.¥g2µ Black has won a pawn. 27.exf3 ¤xf3† 28.¢h1 ¤xd2†–+ 


981. Shakhriyar Mamedyarov – Magnus Carlsen, Moscow (blitz) 2013
17.¤c7! Using the fact that the c7-square is indirectly under attack along the c-file. 17...¦xc7 
18.¥xc7 £xc7 19.b4± 


982. Shakhriyar Mamedyarov – Magnus Carlsen, Shamkir 2014
27...¥xe4! 0–1 28.¥xe4 ¦xd1 29.£xd1 ¤xe4–+ leaves Black a pawn up and much more active, 
since White’s counterattack fails: 30.£d8†? ¢h7 31.¤g6 £f2†  32.¢h1 ¤xg3 mate


983. Magnus Carlsen – Radoslaw Wojtaszek, Tromsø (ol) 2014
31.¥e6!+–  White’s attack is now winning in many ways. The threat is to sacrifice the knight 
and take on f7. 31.¥g4, and others, still leave White much better, but secure no points. 31...¥e8 
31...fxe6 32.¤xe6† with mate. 32.¤d5 32.¦h3+– and other moves are also winning. Black has 
lost connection between his rooks. 32.¥b3 is also a good move, with the threat of checking on 
e6. 32...¤xd5 33.¥xd5 1–0 ¦f3-h3 followed by £f2-f6† is one decisive idea.


984. Magnus Carlsen – Carlos Antonio Hevia, Internet (2) 2016
31...¤xh3†! 32.gxh3 ¦xf3 33.£xf3 £xd4†  Black wins a pawn and has the safer king. His 
advantage is at least bordering on winning (½–½, 41 moves).
